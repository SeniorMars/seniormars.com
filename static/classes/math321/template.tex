\mclm{Dedekind Cuts}{

	Assume:

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \(\NN = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\)
		\item \(\ZZ = 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, \ldots\)
		\item \(\QQ = \left\{ \frac{a}{b} \mid a, b \in \ZZ, b \neq 0 \right\}\)
	\end{enumerate}

	What is \(\RR\)
}

\thm{\(\sqrt{2}\) is not in \(\QQ\) }{

	\pf{Proof}{
		First, assume \(\sqrt{2} = \frac{p}{q}\)

		\begin{align*}
			p, q \in \ZZ, q \neq 0, \gcd(p, q) = 1
		\end{align*}

		Where gcd stands for greatest common divisor at \(p\) and \(q = 1\).

		\begin{align*}
			2 = \left( \frac{p}{q} \right)^{2} = \frac{p^{2}}{q^{2}} \\
			2q^{2} = p^{2}                                           \\
			2 \text{ divides } p^{2} \text{ i.e. \(2 \mid p^{2}\)}   \\
			2 \mid p                                                 \\
			4 \mid p^{2}                                             \\
			p^{2} = 4a                                               \\
			2q^{2} = 4a                                              \\
			q^{2} = 2a                                               \\
			2 \mid q^{2}                                             \\
		\end{align*}

		This is absurd, since we assumed that \(\gcd(p, q) = 1\). Therefore, \(\sqrt{2} \notin \QQ\).
	}

	Here we can see that there are "holes in \(\QQ\)".

}

\dfn{Dedekind cuts}{

	A cut in the \(\QQ\) is a pair of subsets \((A, B)\) of \(\QQ\) such that:

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \(A \cup B = \QQ\), \(A \cap B = \emptyset\)
		\item if \(a \in A, b \in B, a < b\)
		      \if \(A\) contains no largest element ie. \(\nexists a_{o} \in A \text{ such as }\)
		      \(\forall a \in  A, a_{o} \geqq a\).
	\end{enumerate}

	We write \(x = A \mid B\).
}

\dfn{Real number}{
	A real number is a cut in \(\QQ\).

	Examples:

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \(A \mid B = \left\{ r \in \QQ, r < 2 \mid \left\{ r \in \QQ, r \geqq 2 \right\} : = 2 \right\} \)
		\item \(A \mid B = \left\{ r \in \QQ, r^{2} < 2 \mid \left\{ r \in \QQ, r^{2} \geqq 2, r > 0 \right\} : = \sqrt{2}  \right\} \)
	\end{enumerate}

	We call a cut rational if it is as in (i) where 2 is replaced by \(\frac{p}{q} = \QQ\).

	Equivalently, a cut is rational if \(B\)  contains a smallest element (prove this).

	If \(C \in \QQ \quad A \mid B = \left\{ r \in \QQ, r < C \right\} \mid \{r \in Q : r \geqq C\} \)

	Let's call \(C^{*} = A \mid B\) this identifies as \(\QQ\) as a subset of \(\RR\).
}

\dfn{}{

	If \(x = A \mid B\) and \(y = C \mid D\), then if \(A \subset C\) we say \(x \leq y\) and if \(A \nsubseteq C\) we say \(x \nsubseteq y\).

}

\nt{Key fact: The least upper bound property holds in \(\RR\)

	Given a set \(S \subset \RR\), we say \(M \in \RR\), is an upper bound for \(S\) if \(\forall s \in S, s \leq M\).

	Thus, \(M\) is a least upper bound for \(S\) if given any other upper bound \(M^{*}\) for \(S\), \(M \leq M^{*}\).
}

\thm{Upper bound property}{
	If \(S \subset \RR\) is non-empty and bounded above (ie. if it has some upper bound), then it has a least upper bound.

	\pf{Proof}{
		Let \(\sC \in \RR\) be any non-empty subset of \(\RR\) which is bounded above, say by \(X \mid Y\).

		Let \(C = \left\{ a \in  \QQ \mid \text{ for some } A \mid B \in \sC \text{ we have } a \in A\right\} \)

		define \(D = C^{c}\) (meaning the complement of \(C\)).

		then \(Z = C \mid D\)  is a cut (check).

		\(z\)  is an upper bound for \(\sC\) since for any \(A \mid B \in \sC\), \(A \subset C\).

		Now, let \(Z\prime = C\prime \mid D\prime\), any other upper bound for \(\sC\) since \(A \mid B \leq C\prime \mid D\prime, \forall  A \mid B \in \sC\), meaning that \(A \subset C\prime\) for every \(A \mid B \in \sC\).

		Thus, \(C \subset C\prime\), so \(Z \leq Z\prime\)
	}
}

\nt{

	We have some problems now.

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item It's annoying to think of real numbers as pairs of subsets at \(\QQ\) (should ignore later)
		\item Arithmetic ie, how do we add/multiply/subtract/divide real numbers if they are cuts?
	\end{enumerate}
}

\ex{}{

\begin{align*}
	A \mid B + C \mid D = E \mid F                      \\
	\text{what is \(E \mid F\)?}                        \\
	E = \left\{ x + y \colon x \in A, y \in  C \right\} \\
	F = E^{c}                                           \\
\end{align*}

Exercise: check \(E \mid F\) is a cut.

Now let's check.

\begin{align*}
	0^{*} + A \mid                  & B = A \mid B.                                                                                                                  \\
	x = A \mid B                    & \text{ what is \(-x = -(A \mid B)\)?}                                                                                          \\
	-x = C \mid D, \text{ where } C & = \left\{ r \in \QQ \colon \exists b \in  B \text{ s.t. } -r = b \text{ and \(b\) is not the smallest element of B } \right\}.
	D = C^{c}
\end{align*}

check \(x + -x = 0^{*}\)

\begin{align*}
	x = A \mid B, y = C \mid D                                                                                                                \\
	xy = E \mid F                                                                                                                             \\
	\text{assume such that } x, y \ge 0^{*}                                                                                                   \\
	E = \left\{ r \in \QQ \colon r \leq 0 \text{ or } \exists a \in A \text{ and } \exists c \in C \text{ s.t. } a > 0, c > 0, r = ac\right\} \\
	F = E^{c}
\end{align*}

if \(x > 0, y < 0\), then \(xy < -(x(-y))\)

if \((x, y < 0)\), then \(xy > (-x)(-y)\)

Finally, \(0^{*} \cdot x = x \cdot 0^{*} = 0^{*}\).

		Exercise (long and dull): Check this really defines standard arithmetic on \(\RR\).

\dfn{Field}{
	A field \(\FF\) is a set \(F\) with two operations \(+\) and \(\cdot\) such that:

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \(\forall \alpha, \beta, \lambda \in F\quad (\alpha + \beta) + \lambda = \alpha + (\beta + \lambda)\)
		\item \(\forall \alpha, \beta \in F\quad \alpha + \beta = \beta + \alpha\)
		\item \(\exists 0 \in F \text{ s.t. } \forall \alpha \in F \quad \alpha + 0 = \alpha\)
		\item \(\forall \alpha \in F \exists -\alpha \in F \text{ s.t. } \alpha + (-\alpha) = 0\). We sometimes write \(\beta = -\alpha\)
		\item \(\forall \alpha, \beta, \lambda \in F\quad (\alpha \cdot \beta) \cdot \lambda = \alpha \cdot (\beta \cdot \lambda)\)
		\item \(\forall \alpha, \beta \in F\quad \alpha \cdot \beta = \beta \cdot \alpha\)
		\item \(\exists 1 \in F \text{ s.t. } \forall \alpha \in F \quad \alpha \cdot 1 = \alpha\)
		\item \(\forall \alpha \neq 0, \beta \in F \text{ s.t. } \alpha \cdot \beta = 1\). We sometimes write \(\beta = \alpha^{-1}\)
		\item \(\forall \alpha, \beta, \lambda \in F\quad \alpha \cdot (\beta + \lambda) = \alpha \cdot \beta + \alpha \cdot \lambda\)
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Total Order}{
	A total order on a set \(\Omega\) is a relation \(\leq\) such that

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \(\forall \alpha, \beta \in \Omega\quad\) if \(\alpha \neq \beta\), then either \(\alpha < \beta\)  or \(\beta < \alpha\)
		\item \(\forall \alpha \in \Omega, \alpha \nsubset \alpha\).
		\item if \(\alpha \subset \beta\)  and \(\beta < \lambda\), then \(\alpha < \lambda\)
	\end{enumerate}
}

\dfn{Field}{

	A field \(\FF\) is an ordered field if \(F\) has a total order such that

	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item \(\alpha > \beta\), then \(\forall \lambda \in F\), \(\alpha + \lambda > \beta + \lambda\)
		\item \(\alpha > 0 \in F\) and \(\beta > 0 \in F\), then \(\alpha \cdot \beta > 0 \in F\)
	\end{enumerate}
}

\thm{\(\RR\) is an ordered field}{
	\(\RR = \left\{ \text{Dedekind cuts in } \QQ\right\} \)

	\(\QQ \subset \RR\)  is an ordered field.

	\nt{We haven't proved that axioms on ordered fields hold in \(\RR\).}

	Thus, \(\RR\) is complete but not \(\QQ\). This is because \(\RR\)  has the least upper bound property.

	Magnitude or absolute value

		\abs{\alpha} = \begin{cases}
			               \alpha  & \text{ if } \alpha \geqq 0 \\
			               -\alpha & \text{ if } \alpha < 0
		               \end{cases}

\thm{Triangle Inequality}{
	\(\forall x, y \in \RR\), then
	\[
		\abs{x + y} \leq \abs{x} + \abs{y}
	\]

	\pf{Proof}{
		We know from previous knowledge that \(x \leq \abs{x}\)  and \(-x \leq \abs{x}\).

		Now,

		\begin{align*}
			x + y & \leq \abs{x} + y       \\
			      & \leq \abs{x} + \abs{y}

		and

		\begin{align*}
			-x - y & \leq \abs{x} - y       \\
			       & \leq \abs{x} + \abs{y}
		\end{align*}

		Thus, \(\abs{x + y} = x + y \) or \(= -x -y\)
	}
}

\section{Day 2}
Why don't we take the Dedekind cuts in \(\RR\)? I.e. A subset \(A\)  and \(B\) of \(\RR\)

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item \(a < b\) if \(a \subset A\), \(b \subset B\)
	\item \(A \cup B = \RR\) and \(A \cap B = \emptyset\)
	\item \(A\)  has no greatest element
\end{enumerate}

\mprop{Process above just gives \(\RR\) }{

	\pf{Proof}{
		\(x = A \mid B\)  is a cut is \(\RR\).

		We know \(\forall a \in A\)  and any \(b \in B\), thus \(a < b\).

		So, \(b\) is an upper bound for \(A\).

		So, \(A\) has a least upper bound (lub).

		Since \(\RR\) has the lub property.

		let \(y = lub(A)\) and notice

		\[
			a < y \leq b \text{ for every } a \in A, b \in B
		\]

		Now, RH \(\leq\) is \(y\) is a least upper bound.

		And LH \(<\) is that \(y\) is an upper bound and \(A\) has no greatest element.

		\[
			A \mid B = \left\{ x \in \RR \colon x < y \right\}  \mid \left\{ x \in \RR \colon x \geqq y \right\}
		\]

		As such, \(\RR^{*} \subset \left\{ \text{cuts in } \RR\right\} \) is everything. This means that \(\left\{ \text{cuts in } \RR\right\} \) is the same as \(\RR^{*}\) and is the same as \(\RR\)
	}
}

\thm{}{
	There is a unique complete ordered field containing \(\QQ\) as an ordered subfield.

	\mclm{Remark}{
		There are plenty of complete fields containing \(\QQ\) that aren't ordered.
	}
}

\parinf
Now, let's try a different approach of completeness.
\parinn

\dfn{Delta-epsilon}{
	Let \((a_{n})\) be a sequence of real numbers, then we say \((a_{n})\) converges to \(b\) or \(a_{n} \rightarrow b\) or \(\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = b\) if \(\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists N \in \NN \text{ s.t. } \forall n \geqq N, \abs{a_{n} - b} < \epsilon\)
}

\mclm{Cauchy condition}{

	A sequence \(a_{n}\) is a Cauchy if \(\forall \epsilon > 0 \exists N \in \NN \text{ s.t. } \forall n, k \geqq N, \abs{a_{n} - a_{k}} < \epsilon\)

	\mclm{Remark}{
		Convergent sequences are Cauchy.
	}
}

\thm{}{
	Every Cauchy sequence in \(\RR\) is convergent.

	\mclm{Remark}{
		Eventually, Cauchy sequences being convergent will be the definition of completeness in general metric spaces.
	}

	\pf{Proof}{

		First, let's start with some claims.

		\mclm{Claim 1}{

			\((a_{n})\) is bounded.

			Let \(\epsilon = 1\), then \(\exists N \in \NN \text{ s.t. } \forall n, k \geqq N, \abs{a_{n} - a_{k}} < 1\). In particular, \(\abs{a_{k} - a_{N}} < 1\) for all \(k \geqq N\).

			Let's pick \(M\) such that

			\[
				-M < a_1, \ldots, a_{n} < M
			\]

			Then, \(\forall k \geqq N\), we have \(-m -1 < a_{k} < m + 1\).

			Let \(x = \left\{ x \in \RR \colon \exists \text{ infinitely many } n \text{ with } a_{n} \geqq x \right\} \)

			Now \(-M - 1\)  is in \(X\)  since every \(a_{n} \geq -m - 1\) and \(m+1\)  is not in \(x\) since \(a_{n} < m + 1\) for all \(n\).

			So x is a non-empty set that is bounded above.

			Thus, \(x\) has a least upper bound \(b\).
		}

		\mclm{Claim 2}{
			We want to prove \(a_{n} \to b\)  as \(n \to \infty\).

			\pf{Proof}{
				Given some \(\epsilon > 0\), we want to find \(N \in \NN\) such that \(\forall n \geqq N\), \(\abs{a_{n} - b} < \epsilon\).

				Since \(b - \frac{\epsilon}{2} < b\), so there exists infinitely many \(n\) such that \(a_{n} > b - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\) (by the definition of x).

				Now, choose an \(N\) and an \(a_{n}\) for \(n \geq N\) and \(a_{n} > b - \frac{\epsilon}{2}\).

				So that, \(\forall k \in  N\), we have

				\[
					\abs{a_{k} - a_{n}} < \frac{\epsilon}{2}
				\]

				so in particular for all \(k \geq N\), \(a_{k} > b - \epsilon\)

				Now, \(b + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\) is not in x, so at most finitely many \(a_{n}\) are greater than \(b + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\).

				Let \(N_0\) be the largest \(n\)  for which \(a_{n} > b + \frac{\epsilon}{2}\) (or \(b + \epsilon\))

				then if \(k \geq \max\left\{ N, N_0 + 1 \right\} \), thus \(a_{k} - b < \epsilon\)
			}
		}

		And we are done.
	}
}

\nt{
	Some notation on intervals:

	\begin{align*}
		(a, b) = \left\{ x \in \RR \colon a < x < b \right\}       \\
		[a, b] = \left\{ x \in \RR \colon a \leq x \leq b \right\} \\
		(a, b] = \left\{ x \in \RR \colon a < x \leq b \right\}    \\
		[a, b) = \left\{ x \in \RR \colon a \leq x < b \right\}
	\end{align*}.
}

\thm{}{
	Every interval \((a, b)\) has infinitely many rationals and infinitely many irrationals.

	\pf{Proof}{
		Let \(a = A \mid A\prime\) and \(b = B \mid B\prime\) be cuts.

		Additionally, we now that \(a < b\)  and \(B \setminus A \neq \emptyset\).

		Now, choose \(r \in B \setminus A\) to be rational, then since \(B\) has no largest element there is also

		\[
			s \in B \setminus A \text{ with } a < r < s < b
		\]

		Consider \(T \colon [0, 1] \to [r, s]\) and \(t \to r + (s - r)t\) is linear so it is injective and onto.

		Now check that since \(s,r\)  are in \(\QQ\), then \(T\) takes rationals to rationals and irrationals to irrationals.

		So it is enough to find infinitely many rationals in \([0, 1]\) and infinitely many irrationals in \([0, 1]\).
	}
}

\dfn{Archimedian property of \(\RR\) }{

	\(\forall x \in \RR\). There is an \(n \in \NN\) such that \(n > x\).

	\pf{Proof}{
		Let \(x \in \QQ\) and \(x = \frac{p}{q}\) and \(\abs{p} > x\).

		If \(x = A \mid B\), \(r \in B\) is rational, \(x < r = \frac{p}{q}\), and \(x < \abs{p}\).

		\mclm{Remark}{
			There exists non-Archimedian fields like \(\QQ_{p}\)
		}

		\mclm{Remark}{
			Usually, the Archimedian property is \(\forall x \in \RR, x > 0, \exists \frac{1}{n} x\).
		}
	}
}

\thm{\(a, b \in \RR\)}{
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item If \(\forall \epsilon > 0\), and \(a < + \epsilon\), then \(a \leq b\)
		\item If \(x, y \in \RR\), and \(\forall \epsilon > 0\), \(\abs{x - y} \leq \epsilon\), then \(x = y\)
	\end{enumerate}

	\mclm{Upshot}{
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item To prove sharp inequalities we often prove infinitely many not sharp inequalities.
			\item To prove equities, we often prove infinitely many inequalities.
		\end{enumerate}
	}

	\pf{Proof}{
		Either \(a \leq b\) or \(a > b\).

		If \(a > b\) then \(\exists \epsilon > 0\)  with \(0 < \epsilon < a - b\).

		Then, \(\epsilon < a -b < \epsilon\), which is absurd.

}

\dfn{Euclidean space}{
	Cartesian products of sets:

	\[
		A \times B = \left\{ (a,b) \colon a \in A, b \in  B \right\}

	\mclm{Examples}{
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item \(\RR \times \RR = \RR^{2}\)
			\item \(\RR \times \RR \times \RR = \RR^{3}\)
			\item \(\RR^{n} = \RR \times \RR \times \ldots \times \RR\), \(n\) times
		\end{enumerate}
	}
}

\dfn{Vector Spaces}{

	Vectors such as \(\vec{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_{n})\), where addition vectors and you can multiply by scalars.
}

\dfn{Inner Product}{
\(\vec{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_{m})\) and \(\vec{y} = (y_1, \ldots, y_{m})\), then

We can define:

\[
	\left< \vec{x}, \vec{y} \right> = x_1 y_1 + \ldots + x_{m} y_{m} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{i} y_{i}
\]

And

\[
	\sqrt{\left< \vec{x}, \vec{x} \right>} = \sqrt{x_1^{2} + \ldots + x_{m}^{2}} = \abs{\vec{x}}
\]

What is \(\left< \vec{x}, \vec{y} \right>\)  geometrically?

Let's assume \(\abs{\vec{x}} = 1\). Now, let's rotate \(\vec{x}\) to be \((1, 0, \ldots, 0)\).

With \(\vec{x}  = (1, 0, \ldots, 0)\), then \(\left< \vec{x}, \vec{y} \right> = y_1\).

\nt{Draw pic charlie}

\(\left< \vec{x}, \vec{y} \right>\) if \(\abs{\vec{x}} = 1\) is the length of the projection of \(\vec{y}\) onto the direction spanned by \(\vec{x}\).

To make this a proof, we should check rotation preserves inner products.

In general, \(\abs{\vec{x}} = c\)  where

\[
	\left< \vec{x}, \vec{y} \right> = c \left< \frac{\vec{x}}{c} \text{length of 1}, \vec{y} \right>
\]

Which is equals \(C \cdot \) (length of projection of \(\vec{y}\) onto the direction spanned by \(\frac{\vec{x}}{c}\)).

Which is equals to (length of \(\vec{x} \) ) times (length of projection of \(\vec{y}\) onto the direction spanned by \(\frac{\vec{x}}{c}\)).
}

\mclm{Cauchy-Schwarz inequality}{
	Let's define \(\left< \vec{x}, \vec{y}\right> \leq \abs{\vec{x}} \abs{\vec{y}}\)

	\pf{Proof}{

		The LHS is the product of the length of \(\vec{x} \) and the length of the projection of \(\vec{y} \) to the direction spanned by \(\vec{x} \).

		RHS is the product of the lengths. Projections decrease length.

	}

	\nt{Equality in Cauchy-Schwarz inequality happens if and only if \(\vec{x} = c \vec{y} \) }
}

\mclm{Triangle Inequality}{

	\[
		\abs{\vec{x} + \vec{y}} \leq \abs{\vec{x}} + \abs{\vec{y}}
	\]

	\pf{Proof}{

\mclm{Skeleton of Calculus}{
	First students of calculus. Elementary properties of continuous functions.

	Recall \(f \colon [a, b] \to \RR\) is continuous at \(c \in [a, b]\) if \(\forall e > 0, \exists \delta > 0\)

	such that if \(t \in [a, b]\) and \(\abs{t - c} < \delta\), then \(\abs{f(t) - f(c)} < \epsilon\).

	Say \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b]\) if \(f\) is continuous at every point \(c \in [a, b]\).

	\thm{}{
		A continuous function on a closed bounded interval is bounded above and below. i.e.

		There exists \(m, M \in \RR\)  such that
		\[
			m \le  f(x) \le  M \quad \forall x \in [a, b]
		\]

		\pf{Proof}{
			For \(x \in [a, b]\). Let \(V_{x}\) be the values \(f(t)\) for \(a \le t \le x\).

			\[
				V_{x} = \left\{ y \in \RR \colon \exists t \in [a, x] \text{ s.t. } f(t) = y \right\}
			\]

			Now set \(X = \left\{  x \colon V_{x} \text{ is bounded}\right\} \)

			Our goal is to who \(b \in X\) since \(V_{x}\) is bounded, which is equivalent to \(f\) being bounded.

			\mclm{Observe}{
				\(X\) is non-empty since \(a \in X\) since \(V_{a} = \left\{ f(a) \right\} \) is bounded.

			}

			Meaning, that \(X\) is bounded above by \(b\).

			Therefore, \(X\) has a least upper bound \(c\), and \(c \le b\) since \(b\) is an upper bound.

			Now assume for a contradiction that \(c < b\).

			Use that \(f\) is continuous at \(c\). Now let \(\epsilon = 1\), then \(\exists \delta > 0\) such that

			\[
				\abs{x - c} < \delta \implies \abs{f(x) - f(c)} < 1

			This means in \(x \in (c - \delta, c + \delta)\), then \(f(x) \in (f(c) - 1, f(c) + 1)\).

			Now we know there is \(x \in X\) with \(x \in (c - \delta, c)\) as \(c = lub(x)\).

			Otherwise, then \(c - \delta < c\) is an upper bound of \(X\), which is a contradiction.

			Now, let's \(V_{x}\) for any \(x \in [a, c + \delta]\).

			Then, \(V_{x} \subset V_{c} \cup [f(c) - 1, f(c) + 1]\), and so \(V_{x}\) is bounded.

	No uniqueness is guaranteed.

	\pf{Proof}{
		let \(M = lub(\left\{  f(x) \colon x \in [a, b]\right\})\).

		This means that \(m = glb(\left\{ f(x) \colon x in [a, b]\right\} )\) also exists because \(f\) is bounded.

		\nt{
			We're only going to find \(x\), finding \(x_{0}\) is similar using lower bounds.

		Now case time!

		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
			\item Case 1: \(f(a) = M\), and we are done
			\item Case 2: \(f(a) < M\), then \(a \in X\) since \(V_{a} = \left\{ f(a) \right\} \) and \(f(a) < M\).

			      Thus, \(X\) is non-empty, so \(X\) has a least upper bound \(c\) by the least upper bound property.

			      Unless we're already done \(f(x) < M\).

			      Choose \(\epsilon > 0\) such that \(\epsilon < M - f(c)\).

			      By continuity of \(f\) at \(c\), there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that if \(\abs{t - c} < \delta\), then \(\abs{f(t) - f(c)} < \epsilon\).

			      Thus, for all \(x \in [c - \delta, c + \delta]\), we have \(f(x) < M\).

			      And there is some \(x \in (c - \delta, c)\) that is in \(X\).

			      So there is an \([a, x]\), \(f(x) < M\), and on \((c - \delta, c + \delta)\) we have \(f(x) < M\).

			      As such \(f(x) < m\)  on \([a, c + \delta]\).

			      Then there exists points \(x\) to the right of \(c\) where \(lub(V_{x}) < M\).

			      Any \(x \in [c, c + \frac{\delta}{2}]\). This contradicts that \(c = lub(V_{x})\).

			      Unless \(c = b\).

			      If \(c = b\) then \(lub(V_{b}) = lub(\left\{ f(x) \colon a \le x \le b \right\} < m)\).

			      BUT, \(m \le M\), thus we've proved that \(f(c) = m\)

			Such that \(\abs{t - c} < \delta \implies \abs{f(t) - f(c)} < \epsilon\).

			This means that \(t \in (c - \delta, c + \delta)\) then \(f(t) < \gamma\).

			So \(c + \frac{\delta}{2} \in X\) (by definition of \(X\) and \(V_{x}\) ) contradicts that \(c = lub(X)\).

			So \(f(c) \nleq \gamma\).

			Suppose \(f(c) > \gamma\) and \(\epsilon = f(c) - \gamma\). Continuity at \(c\) gives \(\exists \delta > 0\) such that \(\abs{t - c} < \delta \implies \abs{f(t) - f(c)} < \epsilon\).

\thm{}{
	Let \(f \colon M \to N\) is continuous if and only if for every \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that if \(x \in  M\) and \(d_{M}(x, p) < \delta\) then \(d_{N}(f(x), f(p)) < \epsilon\).

	\pf{Proof}{
		Suppose \(f\) is continuous i.e., preserves sequential convergence.

		Now assume \((\epsilon, \delta)\) conditions fails at some \(p \in M\)

		i.e., \(\exists \epsilon > 0\) so that \(\forall \delta > 0\) there exists \(x \in (x_{n})\) such that \(d(x, p) < \delta\) and \(d(f_{x}, f_{p}) \ge \epsilon\).

		Now take \(\delta = \frac{1}{n}\) lets us pick \(x_{n}\) with \(d(x_n, p) < \frac{1}{\delta}\) and \(d(f_{x_{n}}, f_{p}) \ge \epsilon\)

		This means \(x_{n} \to  p\)  but \(f_{x_{n}} \not\to f_{p}\) contradicting sequential continuity.

		Therefore, \((\epsilon, \delta)\) conditions must hold for continuous maps

		Conversely if \(f\) satisfies \((\epsilon, \delta)\) conditions

		suppose \(x_{n} \in M\) has \(x_{n} \to p \in M\)

		we want to show that \(f \colon x_{n} \to f_{p}\) in \(N\).

		Given \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists \(\delta > 0\) such that \(d_{M}(x_{n}, p) < \delta\) implies \(d_{N}(f_{x_{n}}, f_{p}) < \epsilon\).

		And \(x_{n} \to p\) means that for all \(\delta >0\), there exists \(K\) such that if \(n \ge k\) then \(d_{M}(x_{n}, p) < \delta\).

		Therefore, if \(n \ge k\) then \(d_{N}(f_{x_{n}}, f_{p}) < \epsilon\) so \((f_{x_{n}}, f_{p}) < \epsilon\)

		so for every \(\epsilon > 0\), we have found our \(k\) to prove sequential continuity.

		If \(S^{c}\) isn't open then for every \(r > 0\) there is a \(q\) such that \(d(p, q) < r\) and \(q \notin S^{c}\).

		Let us set \(r \approx \frac{1}{n}\), we pick \(q_{n}\) such that \(d(p, q_{n}) < \frac{1}{n}\) and \(q_{n} \in S\).

\mlenma{Lebesgue number lemma}{

		\(X\) is an open covering of a sequentially compact set \(A\) and yet for each \(\lambda > 0\)

		Take \(\lambda_{n} = \frac{1}{n}\) and let \(a_{n}\) be a point where

		then sequentially compactness tell us that there exists a subsequence \(\left\{ a_{n_{k}} \right\} \)

		Since \(X\) covers \(A\) there is \(u \in X\) with \(p \in u\) and since

\thm{}{
	A subset of a complete metric space is compact if and only if it closed and totally bounded.

	\pf{Proof}{
		Assume \(A \subset M\) compact this implies that \(A\) is closed.

		To see it is totally bounded.

		Let \(\epsilon > 0\) be fixed and let \(X\) be an open cover of \(A\) by \(\epsilon-\)balls.

		i.e., \(\left\{ B_{\epsilon}(a) : a \in A \right\} \)

		by compactness there is a finite subcover \(Y\) of \(X\).

		By finitely many \(\epsilon-\)balls cover \(A\).

		Conversely assume \(A\) is totally bounded and closed, want to show \(A\) is compact.

		We'll show sequential compactness by pigeonhole principle.

		let \(\left\{ a_{n} \right\} \) be a sequence in \(A\).

		We want a convergent subsequence.

		Since \(M\) is complete and \(A\) is closed, we'll find a cauchy subsequence.

		Let \(\epsilon_{k} = \frac{1}{k}\)

		A is totally bounded, so there is a finite cover of \(A\) by \(\epsilon_{k}-\)balls.

		\[
			B_{\epsilon_{1}}(p_1), \ldots, B_{\epsilon_{k}}(p_k) \text{ cover } A
		\]

		Note that \(p_{i}\) may not be in \(A\), let alone in \(a_{n}\).

		By pigeonholing, there exists some \(p_{i}\) and infinitely many \(a_{n}\) such that \(a_{n} \in B_{\epsilon_{i}}(p_{i})\).

		Notice: any subset of a totally bounded set is totally bounded (restrict the cover).

		So \(A_{1}\) is totally bounded so covered by finitely many \(\epsilon_{2}-\)balls.

		\[
			B_{\epsilon_{2}}(q_{1}), \ldots, B_{\epsilon_{2}}(q_{k_{2}}) \text{ cover } A_{1}
		\]

		Pigeonhole again, find a subsubsequence of \(\left\{ a_{n_{\ell}} \right\} \subset \left\{ a_{n} \right\} \)

		with all \(a_{n_{\ell}} \in B_{\epsilon_{2}}(q_{i})\) for some \(i\).

		Let \(A_{2} = B_{\epsilon_{2}}(q_{i}) \cap A_{1}\)

		We procced inductively:

		To build \(A_{n} = B_{q_{n}}(X_{n}) \cap A_{n-1}\)

		Where one infinite subsequence of \(\left\{ a_{n} \right\} \) is contained in \(A_{n}\).

		Choose \(a_{n_{k}} \in A_{k} = A_{k-1} \cap M_{\epsilon_{k}}(p_{k})\)

		Gives a subsequence \(\left\{ a_{n_{k}} \right\} \) which I claim is cauchy.

		For every \(\epsilon > 0\) there exists \(N\), where \(\ell, k \ge N\) then \(d(a_{n_{\ell}}, a_{n_{k}}) < \epsilon\).

		Given, \(\epsilon > 0\) choose \(N\) such that \(2k < \epsilon\) .

		Then if \(k, \ell\ \ge N\) then

		\[
			a_{n_{\ell}}, a_{n_{k}} \in A_{N} \subset B_{\frac{1}{N}}(X_{N})
		\]

		Then, \(d(a_{n_{\ell}}, a_{n_{k}}) < diam(B_{\frac{1}{N}}(X_{N})) < \frac{1}{N} < \epsilon\)

		Since, \(\left\{ a_{n_{k}} \right\} \) is cauchy, it converges to some \(p \in M\)

		And since \(A\) is closed, the limit is closed in \(A\).

\dfn{Differentiation}{
	\(f: (a, b) \to \RR\) is differentiable at \(x \in (a, b)\) if:

	\[
		\lim_{t \to x} \frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} = L \text{ exists }
	\]

	We call \(L\) the derivative of \(f\) at \(x\) \(\dot{f}(x) = f'(x) = \frac{df}{dx}(x) = L\)

	Intuition: \(f'(x)\) is the 'best' linear approximation of \(f\) at \(x\).

	\mclm{Rules of Differentiation}{
		We should prove all of these:
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

			\item Differentiability at \(x\) implies continuity at \(x\)
			\item \(f, g\) differentiable at \(x\), then so is \(f + g\) and \((f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)\)
			\item \(f, g\) differentiable at \(x\), then so is \(f \cdot g\) and \((f \cdot g)'(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)\)

			      Other wise known as Leibniz's rule.

			\item the derivative of a constant function is zero
			\item \(f, g\) differentiable at \(x\), \(g(x) \neq 0\), then \(\frac{f}{g}\) is differentiable at \(x\) and:

			      \[
				      \left( \frac{f}{g} \right)'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}}
			      \]

			\item The chain rule: \(f\) differentiable at \(x\) and \(g\) differentiable at \(f(x)\) then \(g \circ f\) is differentiable at \(x\) and:

			      \[
				      (g \circ f)'(x) = g'(f(x))f'(x)
			      \]

\pf{Proof of \(a\) }{
	Continuity is \(f(x) - f(t) \to 0\) as \(x - t \to 0\), \(x \neq t\)

	Point is if \(\lim_{t \to x} \frac{f(x) - f(t)}{x - t} = L\)

	this says that \(f(x) - f(t)\) goes to zero at same rate as \(x - t\).

	Thus,

	\[
		\lim_{t \to x} \left( f(x) - f(t) \right) = L < \infty
	\]

	Means there exists an \(\epsilon\) such that if \(\left\lvert x - t \right\rvert < \delta\), then

	\[
		L - \epsilon < \frac{f(x) - f(t)}{x - t} < L + \epsilon
	\]

	Thus if \(x > t\):

	\begin{align*}
		(L - \epsilon)(x - t) & < f(x) - f(t) < (L + \epsilon)(x - t)        \\
		(L - \epsilon)\delta  & < f(x) - f(t) < (L + \epsilon)\delta (\star)
	\end{align*}

	for continuity for \(\eta > 0\) we want \(\xi\) such that:

	\[
		(t - x ) < \xi \implies \left\lvert f(t) - f(x) \right\rvert < \eta
	\]

	Exercise: use \((\star)\) to compute \(\eta = \frac{\xi}{L}\) and \(\xi = h(n)\) will work.

\pf{Proof of \(e\) }{

\pf{Proof of \(f\) }{
	\mclm{Preamble}{
		If \(f'(x)\) exists then:

		\[
		f(t) - f(x) = (t - x)(f'(x) + u(t))
		\] 

		The above formula is one meaning of 'best linear approximation':

		i.e., \(f(t) = f(x) + (t - x)f'(x) + (t - x)u(t)\) where \(\lim_{t \to x} u(t) = 0\).

		And the \((t-x)u(t)\) is really small when \(t\) is small.
	}

	\pf{Proof of preamble }{
		If:

		\[
		u(t) = \left( \frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} - f'(x) \right)

		Then:

		\[
			\lim_{t \to x} u(t) = 0 = \lim_{t \to x} \left( \frac{f(t) - f(x)}{t - x} - f'(x) \right)
		\] 
		Thus, \(u(t)\) is small when \(t\) is small.
	}

	Now, let's proceed with the chain rule.

	\(y = f(x)\) 

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \(f(t) - f(x) = (t - x)(f'(x) + u(t))\), \(\lim_{t \to x} u(t) = 0\)
		\item \(g(s) - g(y) = (s - y)(g'(y) + v(s))\), \(\lim_{s \to y} v(s) = 0\)

	Let \(s = f(t)\) as \(t \to x\):

	\begin{align*}
		s = f(t) &\to f(x) = y\\
		s \to y
	\end{align*}

	So \(h = g \circ t\) and:

	\[
		\lim_{t \to x} \frac{h(t) - h(x)}{t - x} = (g \circ f)'(x)
	\] 

	\begin{align*}
		h(t)- h(x) &= g(f(t)) - g(f(x)) \\
		&= (f(t) - f(x))(g'(y) + v(s)) \quad \text{ by (2)} \\
		&= (t - x)(f'(x) + u(t))(g'(y) + v(s)) \quad \text{ by (1)} \\
		&= \lim_{t \to x} \frac{(t - x)(f'(x) + u(t))(g'(y) + v(s))}{t - x} \\
		&= \lim_{t \to x} (f'(x) + u(t))(g'(y) + v(s)) \\
		&= \lim_{t \to x} (f'(x)g'(y) + f'(x)v(s) + g'(y)u(t) + v(s)u(t)) \\
		&= f'(x)g'(f(x)) + 0
