I consider myself lucky; I wasn’t born with many things, but when I needed help, I had people willing to help me. Truthfully, I got to where I currently am due to some luck – that’s a privilege. Unfortunately, some people haven’t been as lucky. Look, I don’t consider myself a brilliant person – and that’s okay because I can keep learning. It’s Okay to be dumb right now, but it’s not Okay to keep being dumb – that’s how I live my life. To understand my goal, you need to know that I love learning. I’m unsure how I ended up like this, but the desire for knowledge drives all my actions. In fact, if possible, I want to be hired by a rich person to be their personal research jester. I would spend my day in their basement, and they would throw me a topic, and I would spend the day researching it (ideally with a wage and a gym, though). Despite what I just said, even if such a job existed, I would never take it because there is something more important to me. See, I don’t think you understand: I LOVE learning. This is why I hate, despise, and am tormented when someone doesn’t have the resources to do their best. It fills me with rage that some individuals weren’t lucky enough to write their history-shattering thoughts. Think about it. We had hundreds of years of slavery, discrimination, and even now, suppression of certain groups.\nI am filled with rage when I think how many individuals who are deviations smarter than me have existed but ended up killing their passion because they didn’t have time, luck, or the resources needed to succeed. Imagine what kind of books, papers, and projects those individuals would have created. It hurts to think about it, and I refuse to let it happen anymore. I was lucky – I fell into a group currently being oppressed, but I managed to overcome it with luck. But that’s bullshit. Both my parents never completed middle school, and my sisters are way more intelligent than I am, but I was the only one blessed with luck. I refuse any reason to understand why this is the case. Anyone who wants to learn, do their best, or prove themselves should be able to. I want to read and learn from their work, but life prevents them from doing their best. I want to change that. I will ignite change so that education is genuinely seen as a basic need. Please look forward to my work and proving my words.\nGeneral\n\nGuten Tag!

In the past, when I decided to do this, I mostly didn’t. Sometimes I started, and sometimes I got a chapter done, but typically, it ended with me saying, “nah, this ain’t it.” As you can guess, I’m my worst enemy.\nWriting is scary–at least to me, and every time I get an idea I brainstorm it in my head. Usually, the idea, once conceived, goes through an extra pass in my brain until I decide this is garbage. I know, I know. I should be more kind to myself, but when most of your life is spent reading books, you end up having expectations (scary, I know) about how good a piece should be. Now, there are ideas that were good enough to pass the initial pass: a book about programming languages, one about teaching, and other about code switching. Unfortunately, when I start to write I end up with two realizations: 1) someone has already written about this in a tone and format I wished I envision, 2) I need to research more, or I lack anything meaningful to add.\nPerhaps, it’s not writing I like, but the idea of writing. I’ve always felt that with how much I read, I should at least give back and contribute to this idea of a resource. The problem was that I wanted to contribute something great. I made videos, wrote research papers, and brought proofs to life, but every time I look back, I end up wishing, “damn I could’ve done that better”. Eventually, I realized this was idiotic, since I need experience to get better and to get experience I need to start. I could end up waiting for the right moment, and it could be that it will be great, but I think future me would appreciate having a funny little thing to look back on than a potential masterpiece (please future me 😭).\nIn either case, while I did resolve myself into finishing something, it took a while longer to realize what I wanted to write.  That is until I recited my favorite poem at an open mic:\n\nDemocracy will not come\nToday, this year\nNor ever\nThrough compromise and fear.\nI have as much right\nAs the other fellow has\nTo stand\nOn my two feet\nAnd own the land.\nI tire so of hearing people say,\nLet things take their course.\nTomorrow is another day.\nI do not need my freedom when I’m dead.\nI cannot live on tomorrow’s bread.\nFreedom\nIs a strong seed\nPlanted\nIn a great need.\nI live here, too.\nI want freedom\nJust as you.\n– Langston Hughes\n\nPerhaps, I may be a dog-shit writer, but I do have an interesting life. The only thing is that while I have resolved myself to write something, it’s kinda embarrassing to write about myself. At the end of the day, while these feelings are true, my desire to improve and write surpasses that–and well I am minoring in creative writing. I am going to write poetry. It may not be filled with pretty words or creative formats, but it will be true to myself. I hope you guys look forward to my work.\n","description":"A guy 'promises' to finish a book, this time.","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/book/","path":"/posts/book/","title":"I decided to write a book"},"https://seniormars.com/posts/box-rclone/":{"body":"Motivation\nAs a college student, I’ve had my fair share of data loss nightmares. From the time my final project got corrupted right before finals week to accidentally deleting important files, I’ve learned the hard way that regular backups are non-negotiable. Fortunately, most universities provide students with cloud storage – in my case, Rice University gives each student a generous 2TB of Box storage. But how do we efficiently use this resource for automatic, reliable backups? Enter rclone, the command-line Swiss Army knife for cloud storage.\nWhat is rclone?\nRclone is a command-line program that allows you to sync files between your local machine and various cloud storage providers. Think of it as rsync for the cloud, but with Windows support built-in! It supports dozens of cloud storage systems including Box, Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive. The beauty of rclone is that it’s:\n\nFree and open-source\nFeature-rich (encryption, filtering, mounting, etc.)\nIncredibly efficient with bandwidth and resources\nCross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more)\nNo GUI required (though GUI wrappers exist for those who prefer them)\nScriptable for easy automation\n\nHere’s what my Box storage usage looks like after using rclone for over a year:\n\nWhile rclone is a command-line tool, don’t let that intimidate you if you have never used your terrminal! I’ll provide detailed instructions for all platforms! Let’s get started with setting up your own automated backup system!\nInstallation\nFirst, we need to install rclone on your machine. The process varies slightly depending on your operating system.\nWindows\nFor Windows users, there are several installation methods:\nMethod 1: Installer (Recommended for most users)\n\nDownload the installer from the rclone downloads page\nRun the .exe file\nFollow the installation wizard\nThe installer will add rclone to your PATH automatically\n\nMethod 2: Portable zip file\n\nDownload the zip file from the rclone downloads page\nExtract the zip file to a location of your choice (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\rclone)\nAdd the folder to your PATH:\n\nRight-click on “This PC” or “My Computer” and select “Properties”\nClick on “Advanced system settings”\nClick the “Environment Variables” button\nIn the “System variables” section, find and select the “Path” variable\nClick “Edit”\nClick “New” and add the path to your rclone folder\nClick “OK” on all dialogs to save the changes\n\n\n\nMethod 3: Using Scoop\nIf you use the Scoop package manager for Windows:\n\nMethod 4: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)\nIf you use WSL, you can follow the Linux instructions below within your WSL environment.\nmacOS\nIf you’re using macOS (as I am), the easiest way to install rclone is with Homebrew:\n\nLinux\nOn most Linux distributions, you can install rclone using your package manager:\nDebian/Ubuntu:\n\nArch Linux\n\nSetting Up rclone with Box\nNow that rclone is installed, we need to configure it to work with our Box account.\nInitial Configuration\nRun the following command to start the configuration process:\n\nThis interactive setup will walk you through creating a new remote connection. Here’s what to expect:\n\nEnter n to create a new remote, and name it box (or whatever you prefer).\n\nChoose box from the list of storage types.\n\nUnless you’ve created your own Box App (I’ll show you how later), leave these blank and press Enter.\n\nAgain, leave these blank and press Enter.\n\nPress Enter to select the default option (user).\n\nType y and press Enter to authenticate via your web browser.\nA browser window should open automatically. Log in to your Box account and authorize rclone for access. Once authorized, the browser window will display a success message, and you can close it and return to the terminal.\n\nType y and press Enter to save the configuration.\nTesting the Connection\nLet’s make sure our connection works by listing the files in your Box account:\n\nThis command should list all files at the root of your Box account. If you see the file listing, congratulations – your rclone configuration is working correctly!\nCreating a Backup Script\nNow that rclone is configured, let’s create a backup script to automate the process. The script will synchronize specified directories from your local machine to Box.\nHere’s a basic example:\n\nLet’s break down what this script does:\n\nSOURCE=\"$HOME\" - Sets the source directory to your home directory.\nDEST=\"box:backup\" - Sets the destination to a folder called “backup” in your Box account.\nEXCLUDE_FILE=\"$HOME/.config/rclone/exclude_backup\" - Specifies a file containing patterns of files/directories to exclude.\nrclone sync - Synchronizes the source directory to the destination.\n\n--update - Skip files that are newer on the destination.\n--verbose - Show detailed progress.\n--transfers 30 - Number of file transfers to run in parallel.\n--checkers 8 - Number of checkers to run in parallel.\n--contimeout 60s - Connect timeout.\n--timeout 300s - I/O timeout.\n--retries 3 - Number of retries if a file transfer fails.\n--low-level-retries 10 - Number of low-level retries.\n--stats 30s - Print stats every 30 seconds.\n--exclude-from \"$EXCLUDE_FILE\" - Read exclude patterns from the specified file.\n--delete-excluded - Delete files from the destination that are excluded.\n\n\n\nCreating an Exclude File\nThe exclude file is crucial for efficient backups. It prevents unnecessary files from being backed up, saving both time and storage space.\nFor macOS/Linux:\nCreate the exclude file:\n\nFor Windows:\nCreate the exclude file:\n\nNow edit this file with your favorite text editor and add patterns for files and directories you want to exclude from your backups.\nExample for macOS:\n\nExample for Windows:\n\nFeel free to customize this list according to your needs. The patterns follow the same format as .gitignore files, with a few additions:\n\n* matches any sequence of non-separator characters\n** matches any sequence of characters including separators\n? matches any single non-separator character\n[chars] matches any character in the set\n{alt1,alt2} matches any of the alternatives\n\nMaking the Script Executable\nSave your backup script to a file, e.g., ~/bin/backup_to_box.sh, and make it executable:\n\nEnhancing Your Backup Script\nLet’s improve our basic script with some additional features. I’ll provide examples for both macOS/Linux and Windows.\nFor macOS/Linux:\n\nFor Windows:\n\nThe Windows script includes:\n\nProper path handling for Windows file systems\nLock file mechanism to prevent multiple instances\nCapturing installed programs using PowerShell\nDetailed logging with timestamps\n\nThis enhanced script adds:\n\nLogging to a file for easier troubleshooting\nA lock mechanism to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously\nAutomatic saving of installed packages (in this case, Homebrew packages)\n\nAutomating Backups\nNow that we have our script, let’s set it up to run automatically at regular intervals.\nUsing cron (macOS/Linux):\nOn macOS and Linux, cron is the traditional way to schedule recurring tasks.\nEdit your crontab file:\n\nHere’s my personal crontab setup that runs the backup twice daily (8 AM and 8 PM) and logs the output:\n\nHere’s what the numbers mean:\n\n0 - minute (0-59)\n8/20 - hour (0-23), running at 8 AM and 8 PM\n* - day of month (1-31)\n* - month (1-12)\n* - day of week (0-7, both 0 and 7 represent Sunday)\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      The cron job runs in a limited environment, so you might need to use full paths to all executables in your script. Notice how I’ve used absolute paths in my example above.\n\n    \n  \n\nUsing launchd (macOS)\nOn macOS, you can also use launchd, which offers more flexibility than cron.\nCreate a plist file at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.box-backup.plist:\n\nReplace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username. Then load the job:\n\nUsing Task Scheduler (Windows)\nWindows users can use Task Scheduler for automated backups. Here’s a detailed guide:\n\nFirst, create a batch file for your rclone command. Create a new file called backup_to_box.bat in an appropriate location (e.g., C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Scripts\\):\n\n\n\n\nNow set up the task:\n\n\nOpen Task Scheduler (search for it in the Start menu)\n\n\nClick “Create Task” (not “Create Basic Task” for more options)\n\n\nOn the General tab:\n\nEnter a Name (e.g., “Box Backup”)\nSelect “Run whether user is logged on or not” for unattended operation\nCheck “Run with highest privileges”\n\n\n\nOn the Triggers tab:\n\nClick “New” to add a trigger\nSelect “Daily” and set it to run at your preferred time(s)\nYou can add multiple triggers for morning and evening backups\n\n\n\nOn the Actions tab:\n\nClick “New”\nAction: “Start a program”\nProgram/script: Browse to your batch file (C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Scripts\\backup_to_box.bat)\n\n\n\nOn the Conditions tab:\n\nUncheck “Start the task only if the computer is on AC power” if you want it to run on battery\nConsider checking “Start only if the following network connection is available” if you want it to run only on certain networks\n\n\n\nOn the Settings tab:\n\nCheck “Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed”\nSet “If the task fails, restart every:” to handle temporary failures\n\n\n\n\n\nClick “OK” and enter your password when prompted.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Windows paths use backslashes (\\) instead of forward slashes. Make sure all your paths use the correct format. Also, if you install rclone in a non-standard location, adjust the path to rclone.exe accordingly.\n\n    \n  \n\nAdvanced rclone Features\nBandwidth Limiting\nIf you don’t want your backups to saturate your internet connection, you can limit the bandwidth:\n\nThis limits the transfer to 1 megabyte per second. You can also specify a time schedule:\n\nThis sets different limits throughout the day.\nWindows Example:\n\nEncryption\nIf you’re concerned about the privacy of your data in the cloud, rclone supports encryption:\n\nThen use box-crypt: as your destination in your backup script.\nFast Listing\nFor large directories with many files, you can speed up operations with fast list:\n\nThis uses more memory but can significantly speed up the listing process.\nMount\nOne of my favorite features is the ability to mount your Box storage as a local filesystem:\nFor macOS/Linux:\n\nFor Windows:\n\nThis mounts your entire Box account at ~/box on macOS/Linux or as drive X: on Windows. You can then browse it like any local directory.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      For Windows users, the mount command requires WinFsp to be installed. Download it from https://winfsp.dev/ and install it before attempting to mount.\n\n    \n  \n\nServe\nRclone can also serve your files over HTTP, WebDAV, FTP, or SFTP:\n\nThis allows you to access your Box files through a web browser at http://localhost:8080.\nFiltering Options\nRclone offers powerful filtering beyond the exclude file:\n\nTroubleshooting\nAuthentication Errors\nIf you encounter authentication errors, you may need to reauthorize rclone:\n\nConnection Timeouts\nFor unreliable internet connections, increase the timeout values:\n\nPath Issues on Windows\nWindows users might encounter issues with path formats:\n\n\nBackslash vs. Forward Slash: Windows uses backslashes (\\) in file paths, but you need to escape them in batch files with another backslash or use caret (^) before special characters.\n\n\nLong Path Names: If you encounter “path too long” errors, you can prefix your paths with \\\\?\\ to enable long path support:\n\n\n\nSpaces in Paths: Always enclose paths with spaces in quotes:\n\n\n\nSync Taking Too Long\nIf syncs are taking too long, consider:\n\nRefining your exclude list\nUsing --max-age to only sync recent files\nUsing --size-only to compare file sizes instead of modification times\nUsing --transfers to adjust concurrent transfers (higher for fast connections)\n\nWindows-Specific Performance Tips\nWindows users can improve performance with:\n\n\nDisable Virus Scanning for rclone: Add exclusions in your antivirus for rclone.exe and your backup directories.\n\n\nAdjust Priorities: Run rclone with higher priority:\n\n\n\nDisable Indexing: Disable Windows Search indexing on your backup directories.\n\n\nLogging and Debugging\nFor detailed troubleshooting, add the -vv flag for very verbose output:\n\nFor even more detailed logs:\n\nThis will dump all HTTP headers and response bodies to the log.\nWindows Event Log Integration\nWindows users can log to the Windows Event Log:\n\nYou can then view these logs in the Windows Event Viewer.\nConclusion\nSetting up automated backups to Box using rclone is a powerful way to ensure your important data is safely stored in the cloud. The initial setup might seem a bit technical, but once configured, your backup system will run reliably with minimal maintenance.\nRemember that a good backup strategy follows the “3-2-1 rule”:\n\n3 copies of your data\n2 different storage types\n1 copy offsite\n\nBox with rclone helps you satisfy the offsite requirement, but consider combining it with local backups for a comprehensive strategy.\nI hope this guide helps you keep your data safe! Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or suggestions for improving this backup system.\n","description":"A guy decides to share his backup setup","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/box-rclone/","path":"/posts/box-rclone/","title":"Automated Backups Using rclone + Box"},"https://seniormars.com/posts/braille-math/":{"body":"Motivation\nYes, I am a math major, and yes, I am a linguistics major. I know what you’re thinking: “Of course, he is into category theory and formal languages because of this 🙄.” Wrong. I am into those things, but that’s just because I’m a “nerd”™ not because of my majors. The truth is I like Math because [too long to explain here], and I like Linguistics because [also too long to explain here], yet I never thought about the obvious intersection until I took a course on Braille at my university.\n“Ling 327: Research on Braille” transformed my understanding of writing systems, disabilities, and most importantly, how we encode mathematical meaning. What began as a fascinating exploration of a tactile writing system evolved into a profound questioning of how we represent abstract mathematical concepts. The class didn’t just teach me about Braille – it challenged my fundamental assumptions about notation systems and accessibility in mathematics (this blog is, in part, an excuse to share that rabbit hole with you).\nI should note upfront: this isn’t your typical academic exposition. While I’ve written a formal research proposal on being multipled disabilities, tactile systems, and mathematics for my final paper, this blog aims to be something different. Consider it a journey through the questions that kept me awake at night, the unexpected connections I discovered, and the sobering realizations about accessibility in mathematical education.\nA disclaimer: I’m still learning Grade 2 Braille (don’t worry, we’ll get to what that means), and I make no claims to expertise. Instead, I offer perspective as someone straddling two worlds – the abstract realm of mathematics and the structured landscape of linguistics – discovering how they converge in unexpected ways through Braille. My hope is that by sharing these insights and questions, we can spark a broader conversation about how we represent and teach mathematics across different modalities.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      I have tried my best to make this blog accessible to all readers, including those who are blind or visually impaired. If you encounter any issues with accessibility, please let me know so I can address them.\n\n    \n  \n\nBraille: A Brief Introduction\nIf you’ve ever run your fingers across Braille text, you’ve encountered one of humanity’s most ingenious writing systems. But calling Braille merely a “translation” of print does it a disservice – it’s a fully realized tactile representation of language, as distinct from print English as cursive is from typeface. Like any writing system, Braille has evolved to meet the needs of its users, developing its own conventions, shortcuts, and solutions to linguistic challenges.\nAt its core, Braille consists of cells – small rectangular units containing up to six raised dots arranged in two columns of three. These dots, through various combinations, can represent letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and even entire words.\nBelow is a visual representation of the basic Braille alphabet:\n\nBut what makes Braille fascinating isn’t just its tactile nature – it’s how it has evolved into different grades of complexity to serve different needs.\nGrade 1 Braille is what most people envision: a one-to-one representation of letters and numbers. Each letter corresponds to a specific dot pattern, making it ideal for beginners or materials requiring exact spelling, like dictionaries. Grade 2 Braille introduces contractions – symbols that represent common letter combinations or whole words. Imagine an entire system of abbreviations akin to how “&amp;” represents “and” in print. The word “the,” for example, is reduced to a single character, enhancing reading speed and efficiency. For personal notes and shorthand, there is Grade 3 Braille, a more abbreviated form used informally.\nIt’s important to note that Braille isn’t exclusively for those with total vision loss. Legal blindness, defined as visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in the better-seeing eye with correction or a visual field of 20 degrees or less, affects individuals across a spectrum of visual abilities. Many legally blind people can perceive shapes, light, or read large print, and Braille remains a vital tool for literacy.\nThe digital age has expanded Braille’s accessibility. Refreshable Braille displays, online tutorials, and Braille translation software have made learning and using Braille more convenient. This shift has democratized Braille education, allowing broader access beyond specialized instruction.\nUltimately, Braille stands as a testament to human ingenuity, demonstrating how language can transcend sight. While print English relies on visual spacing and layout, Braille translates the same information into a form accessible by touch. It is not just a writing system – it’s a bridge that ensures literacy and communication for all.\nHow Do You Do Math in Braille?\nMathematics in Braille is where language meets logic – where theoretical elegance confronts practical necessity. If you thought reading math in print was challenging, imagine transforming the spatial dance of equations into linear patterns of raised dots. This fundamental challenge birthed two remarkable systems: Nemeth Code and Unified English Braille (UEB) technical notation, each representing different philosophies about how mathematical concepts should be touched, read, and understood.\nNemeth Code: A System Born from Necessity\nNemeth Code, developed by Dr. Abraham Nemeth in 1952, revolutionized how blind and visually impaired individuals engage with mathematics. As a blind mathematician frustrated by the inadequacies of existing Braille systems for higher math, Nemeth designed a code that could represent everything from simple arithmetic to advanced calculus.\nNemeth’s brilliance lies in how it repurposes the lower part of the Braille cell to represent numbers and mathematical symbols. This makes numbers immediately distinguishable from letters, akin to having a dedicated “math mode” in LaTeX. For instance, the digit “5” and the letter “e” might share the same dot pattern, but context and specific rules ensure no confusion. This compact and efficient system allows for clearer, more streamlined representations of complex expressions.\nHere are some examples of Nemeth Code in action:\n\n\nUnified English Braille (UEB): The All-in-One Approach\nUEB, adopted officially in the United States in 2016, strives to standardize Braille across all contexts – including literature, science, and mathematics. UEB technical notation integrates math within the general Braille code, avoiding the need to switch between different systems (like literary Braille and Nemeth). However, this comes at a cost: UEB often requires more cells to represent mathematical expressions.\nConsider a basic equation like (2 + 2 = 4). In UEB, each operator (like “+” and “=”) typically takes two cells to convey, whereas Nemeth can express the same equation more compactly. UEB prioritizes consistency over efficiency, making it more intuitive for individuals who prefer seamless transitions between math and text.\n\n\nThe U.S. Approach: A Dual-System Landscape\nIn the United States, students are not strictly bound to one system. Educational institutions often let students and educators choose between Nemeth and UEB, depending on factors such as:\n\nThe student’s prior exposure to Braille math systems.\nAcademic aspirations (Nemeth is generally preferred for advanced STEM fields).\nInstructional resources available in each code.\nCognitive and learning preferences of the student.\n\nThink of it like programming languages: Nemeth is Python – concise, specialized, and efficient for math-heavy environments. UEB, on the other hand, is Java – verbose but consistent, allowing integration across different domains.\nHandling Spatial Relationships in Braille Math\nOne of the most remarkable challenges in Braille math is conveying spatial relationships. In print, superscripts, subscripts, and fractions are visually obvious. Braille, being linear, can’t rely on visual positioning. Instead, both Nemeth and UEB use special markers and indicators to show spatial concepts.\nFor example:\n\nFractions are denoted by opening and closing symbols, much like parentheses in programming, clearly outlining the numerator and denominator.\nSuperscripts and subscripts are indicated by specific prefix symbols that “shift” the reader into a different context temporarily.\n\nThis ensures that mathematical structure isn’t lost – a crucial aspect of learning math tactilely.\nThe Choice: A Story of Trade-offs\nThe existence of both systems in the U.S. isn’t just about providing options – it’s about recognizing the deeply personal nature of mathematical understanding. Some students thrive with Nemeth’s efficient specialization, while others prefer UEB’s consistent approach across all subjects. This choice mirrors broader debates in education about specialization versus integration, efficiency versus accessibility.\nWhat makes this narrative particularly compelling is how it challenges our assumptions about mathematical notation. For sighted readers, mathematical symbols are visual shortcuts, but in Braille, they become tactile pathways to understanding. Whether through Nemeth’s elegant efficiency or UEB’s systematic consistency, these codes demonstrate that mathematics isn’t just about what we see – it’s about how we think.\nA Random Segment: Math on the Web\nLet’s talk about something that often flies under the radar: how do blind and visually impaired individuals read mathematical equations online? While sighted users enjoy beautifully rendered LaTeX or MathML equations (thanks to tools like MathJax), navigating mathematical content without vision requires an entirely different toolkit.\nTake this Type Theory proof tree, for instance:\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$f : A \\rightarrow B$}\n\\AxiomC{$g : \\neg B = B \\rightarrow \\bot$}\n\\AxiomC{$x : A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$f(x) : B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$g(f(x)) : \\bot$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$h : A \\rightarrow \\bot$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$h \\in \\neg A$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$f \\rightarrow g \\rightarrow \\neg A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\nOr this theorem: Theorem: Let $f: [a, b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such\nthat $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs (i.e., $ f(a) \\cdot f(b) &lt; 0 $).\nThen, there exists a point $ c \\in [a, b] $ such that $ f(c) = 0 $.\nTo a sighted user, this renders as an elegant tree structure, with branches clearly showing logical dependencies. But for a Braille user, this same proof needs to be transformed into a linear sequence of symbols that preserves both the logical structure and the mathematical notation. This is where modern screen readers and specialized tools come into play, each taking a different approach to this complex translation problem.\nMathJax: Bridging the Divide\nMathJax marks a major leap forward. Known for rendering LaTeX and MathML on web pages, MathJax now supports Braille outputs. This means users can experience equations tactilely or through screen readers, dynamically generating representations in either Nemeth or “Euro”, depending on personal preference.\nThe flexibility is remarkable – the same equation that appears visually stunning to one user can be explored in tactile form by another. This multimodal approach not only enhances accessibility but also promotes deeper engagement with mathematical content.\n\n\nThe Role of Screen Readers: JAWS and Math Navigation\nMathJax isn’t alone in this effort. JAWS (Job Access With Speech), one of the leading screen readers, has developed impressive math capabilities. When encountering equations in Microsoft Word or MathML on web pages, JAWS activates its Math Viewer – essentially an interactive tool that breaks down equations into manageable components.\nUsers can navigate equations piece by piece using keyboard shortcuts, with tactile feedback via Braille displays. It’s like dissecting an equation step-by-step, mirroring how sighted users might “scan” an equation visually.\nEven more exciting is JAWS’s Braille Math Editor. This feature allows users to input equations in Nemeth Braille directly from a Braille display. As they type, the system generates a visual preview for teachers or collaborators, fostering seamless interaction between sighted and visually impaired mathematicians.\nMath Isn’t Just Visual – It’s Multimodal\nThe real significance of these tools extends beyond accessibility. They challenge the assumption that mathematics is inherently visual. When complex spatial relationships (like fractions, superscripts, and matrices) are translated into linear Braille sequences, new insights into mathematical structure and logic emerge.\nThis shift highlights something profound: mathematics is about relationships and patterns, not just symbols on a page. By adapting to tactile and auditory forms, math becomes a richer, more inclusive experience.\nChallenges Ahead\nDespite these advancements, barriers persist. Not all online math content is accessible – many equations exist as images or untagged PDFs, which screen readers can’t interpret. Even when MathML is used, improper markup can create stumbling blocks.\nMoreover, while tools like MathJax and JAWS excel with structured equations, more esoteric notations or heavily visual mathematical diagrams (like graphs or geometry) remain challenging to translate.\nYet the progress is undeniable. As these technologies evolve, they promise to reshape the landscape of online math education, ensuring that everyone, regardless of visual ability, can explore the beauty and rigor of mathematics.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          latex2nemeth and programming\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Check this out! latex2nemeth. I geeked out when I found this – it’s a LaTeX package that converts LaTeX math expressions into Nemeth Braille. The fact that someone thought to create this shows the incredible creativity and dedication of the accessibility community.\nAlso, there is this cool video: \n\n\n\n that shows how a blind programmer...well, programs. It's a fascinating look at how someone navigates code without sight, relying on screen readers and Braille displays. It's a reminder that accessibility isn't just about reading content – it's about creating content, too.\n    \n  \n\nThe Question\nHere’s what sent me down this rabbit hole: the intersection of dyscalculia and Braille mathematics. Let me back up a bit—dyscalculia, often oversimplified as “math dyslexia,” is a learning disability that affects the ability to understand and process numerical concepts. Some people seem to inherently “get” numbers, while others wrestle with even basic mathematical relationships. Dyscalculia makes those struggles neurological rather than purely educational.\nWhile taking “Ling 327: Research on Braille,” I stumbled across an idea that wouldn’t let me sleep. We know dyslexia is fundamentally neurological—it persists whether someone reads print or Braille. This hit me like a mathematical proof that just clicks: if dyslexia transcends the medium, what about dyscalculia? And more importantly, what happens when these conditions intersect with visual impairment, creating what researchers term “multiple disabled” conditions?\nThe academic silence on this is almost poetic in its completeness. There’s extensive research on multiple disabilities in education, yet this intersection—dyscalculia and visual impairment—remains largely unexplored. Dig through papers and databases, and you’ll find studies on visual impairment and learning, or on dyscalculia in sighted learners. But the overlap? It’s a void where understanding should be.\nConsider this: reading text, whether in print or Braille, is linear—you follow a path, tracing a thread through space. Mathematics, though, demands more. A fraction isn’t just a string of symbols; it’s a spatial relationship. An equation isn’t merely characters in a line; it’s a choreography of elements arranged in patterns that convey meaning. How does the brain interpret these spatial relationships when they’re translated into linear sequences of raised dots? And what happens when that brain already processes numbers differently?\nThis isn’t just academic curiosity—it’s about understanding the nuanced interplay of multiple disabilities. If someone experiences both visual impairment and dyscalculia, are they simply dealing with two parallel challenges, or does something more intricate emerge from that intersection? Research on multiple disabilities shows that conditions rarely stack neatly; they interact, creating unique learning needs that can’t be addressed by treating each condition separately.\nThe implications are profound. Systems like Nemeth and UEB already translate visual mathematics into tactile representations, but have we ever considered how those systems interact with neurodivergent cognition? Could the very tools designed to make math accessible inadvertently pose new obstacles for learners with dyscalculia?\nI couldn’t shake these questions. They followed me from the classroom to the library, from research papers to late-night conversations. And maybe that’s exactly what’s needed—not immediate answers, but better questions about how to support learners navigating multiple intersecting disabilities.\nThe way forward isn’t just about plugging gaps in academic literature—it’s about recognizing that every intersection of disability offers unique insights into how we process and learn mathematics. This exploration might not only aid students with multiple disabilities; it could shift how we fundamentally understand mathematical cognition.\nWhat Comes Next?\nAnd here we are—at the end of this mathematical journey (or perhaps just the beginning?). I’ve dragged you through the fascinating world of Braille mathematics, down the rabbit hole of multiple disabilities, and into the uncharted territory of dyscalculia in tactile systems. If your head is spinning with questions, welcome to the club – that’s exactly how I felt after that Braille course!\nThe gap in our understanding of dyscalculia in Braille users isn’t just a research oversight – it’s a call to action. Each unanswered question represents an opportunity to make mathematics more accessible, to deepen our understanding of how the brain processes numerical concepts, and ultimately, to foster more inclusive educational environments.\nI hope this exploration has sparked your curiosity as much as it did mine. Whether you’re a mathematician, educator, disability researcher, or just someone who enjoys diving into unexpected intellectual adventures, there’s something profound about discovering these unexplored intersections. They remind us that even in fields as well-studied as mathematics and disability research, mysteries remain—waiting to be unraveled.\n","description":"A guy explores the obvious intersection of his two majors.","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/braille-math/","path":"/posts/braille-math/","title":"Braille, Dyscalculia, and Mathematics: How?"},"https://seniormars.com/posts/everyday-birthday/":{"body":"Motivation\nA few days ago, I was working on a UI framework (in rust btw) for a personal project; abruptly, I decided to check my group chat and noticed a screenshot of a question from our university’s anonymous forum, Fizz. As it so happened, the question was a math problem–instantly, it became clear to me that I was nerd sniped (as any math major would). The question was simple and one you have probably thought about at some point in your life:\n\nDo yall think there is a person at rice for every birthday in the year? Like\ndo you think every birthday is represented in the student body?\n– Anonymous\n\nNot only that, but it was a classic problem in probability theory! Unfortunately, by the time I saw the question, someone had posted a pretty good answer (funnily enough, someone thought I was the one who anonymously posted the answer). Alas, my nerd-sniped brain was already in full gear, so instead, I am taking this as an opportunity to polish my writing skills 😎. Join me as I walk you through my (hopefully rigorous) exploration of this classic problem.\nThe Problem and possible leads\nIn all honestly, this question is fun and can be approached in many ways. Clearly, a trivial solution would involve me, a rice student, having 365 (.25?) friends and checking if each has a different birthday. In the best case, the answer is yes; in the worst case, the answer is no. Unfortunately, I spend most of my time at the library, so such a method would be infeasible; a more rigorous approach is desirable. As a math major, I have found abstraction often easier to work with than a specific case. Naturally, we’ll start by abstracting the problem to a more general form and then returning to the original problem.\nIf you are familiar with continuous probability theory, perhaps you’ve heard about the Birthday Paradox. The paradox states that for a random group of 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday (surprising, I know). While this is not the same problem as our question, they are tangentially related! Hence, we will use some of the same techniques (notably counting 😭). Let’s rephrase the question with some assumptions for our first lead!\n\n“Do you think it’s likely that a collection of Rice University students would include at least one student with each possible birthday? Assuming each birthday is equally likely, how many students would be needed to expect that every day of the year, 365 days, is someone’s birthday?” \n— Problem 1.1\n\nThe most important part of this rephrasing is the assumption (a restriction which we will remove later) of equally likely birthdays and the number of days. Moreover, while the rephrasing is a bit awkward to some, to others, it may remind them of another problem: The Coupon Collector!\nThe Coupon Collector Problem and Expected Value\nNow, I’m not a computer scientist, so I won’t simply “reduce” the problem and call it a day. First, the goal of the coupon collector problem is to determine the expected number of coupons needed to collect all coupons. Instead of coupons, we deal with birthdays and quantify the number of students needed to ensure having all birthdays. In other words, we are trying to calculate the expected number of students required to have all birthdays, which is precisely Problem 1.1!\nThe idea is simple: keep adding students one by one until you have all birthdays. Following this process, you notice that the first student is guaranteed a unique birthday. Moreover, each new student has a probability of $\\frac{x}{365}$ of having a new birthday, where $x$ is the number of unique birthdays left. In contrast, the expected probability of how many students you have to go through until you see a new birthday is the reciprocal probability of seeing a new birthday, i.e., $\\frac{365}{x}$. We derive this as if $k$ birthdays are already taken, the probability of $P_{\\text{new}}$ is given by $P_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{365 - k}{365}$; hence, geometric distribution (proof:1) tell us that the probability to counter an event with probability $P_{\\text{new}}$ is $\\frac{1}{P_{\\text{new}}}$—which is $\\frac{365}{365 - k}$. Finally, from our assumptions, we know that the birthday is equally likely (independent), which means a new birthday does not depend on the previous birthdays. Therefore, I claim we can sum the expected number of students needed to see a new birthday for each $k$ unique birthday multiplied by the number of birthdays. Let’s prove this:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Proof of claim\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Proof: Let $T$ be the number of students needed for all birthdays to be seen, and let $T_k$ be the number of students needed to see a new birthday, given that $k - 1$ birthdays are already taken. As we have noted before, the probability of seeing a new birthday is $P_k = \\frac{365 - k}{365}$, which means the expected number of students needed to see a new birthday is $\\frac{1}{p_k} = \\frac{365}{365 - k}$. Now, let’s readjust the sum to avoid diving by zero, and we see:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[T] &amp;= \\mathbb{E}[(T_1 + T_2 + \\ldots + T_{365})]&amp; &amp;\\\\\n&amp;= \\mathbb{E}[T_1] + \\mathbb{E}[T_2] + \\ldots + \\mathbb{E}[T_{365}]&amp; &amp;\\quad\\text{by linearity of expectation}\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{1}{p_1} + \\frac{1}{p_2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{p_{365}}&amp; &amp;\\quad\\text{by definition of expectation}\\\\\n&amp;= \\frac{365}{365} + \\frac{365}{364} + \\ldots + \\frac{365}{1}&amp; &amp;\\quad\\text{by definition of } \\frac{1}{p_k}\\\\\n&amp;= 365 \\left( \\frac{1}{365} + \\frac{1}{364} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{1} \\right)&amp; &amp;\\quad\\text{by distributive property}\\\\\n&amp;= 365 \\sum_{i=1}^{365} \\frac{1}{i}&amp; &amp;\\quad\\text{as desired} \\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n    \n  \n\nNow, we would be done here, but notice that the last summation is the $n^{th}$ harmonic number, $H_n$. This summation is known to be $\\ln(n) + \\gamma + \\epsilon(n)$, where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and $\\epsilon(n)$ is the error term. Hence, we can approximate the expected number of students needed to see all birthdays as $365 H_{365} \\approx 365 \\ln(365) + 365 \\gamma + \\epsilon(365)$. If we let $\\gamma \\approx 0.5772156649$ and the error bound be bounded by $\\frac{1}{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{n})$, then we can calculate this as approximately $2364$ students needed!\nExploring leap days through our lead\nHowever, an astute reader would notice that this is still the expected number of students needed to see all birthdays, not the number required to ensure all birthdays are seen. For now, however, we will explore this setup more. For instance, what if we account for leap days, i.e., someone is born on February 29th? Let’s rephrase the problem with this in mind:\n\n“Do you think it’s likely that a collection of Rice University students would include at least one student with each possible birthday? Assuming each birthday is equally likely, how many students would be needed to expected that every day of the year, including leap days, is someone’s birthday?” \n— Problem 1.15\n\nEasily, we can change our sum to $365.25$ instead of $365$, and the expected number of students needed to see all birthdays would be $\\frac{365.25}{365} \\cdot 2364 \\approx 2366$ students, but this is without our error bound, i.e., the probabilities of the event happening to adjust for leap days. In fact, to get the error bound, we have to multiply the likelihood of covering all possible birthdays in a random group process such that each day has a slightly different probability due to our leap day. Using the logic described previously, to calculate such a risk, we can multiply:\n$$\n\\frac{365}{365.25} \\times \\frac{364}{364.25} \\times \\frac{363}{363.25} \\times \\cdots \\times \\frac{1}{1.25} = \\frac{365!}{365.25^{365}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{365} \\frac{i}{i + 0.25}\n$$\nWhile this might look complicated (it is!) – thankfully, this looks like the gamma function! The gamma function is a generalization of the factorial function to the $\\mathbb{C}^+$, and it is defined as $\\Gamma(n) = (n - 1)!$. This allows us to deal with some non-integer values, and in our case, we can use the gamma function to calculate the probability of seeing all birthdays in a group of 365.25 students. Hence,\n$$\n\\prod_{i=1}^{365} \\frac{i}{i + 0.25} = \\frac{\\Gamma(366)\\Gamma(1.25)}{\\Gamma(366.25)}\n$$\nNow, thanks to Wolfram Alpha, we can calculate this:\n\nBut we are exploring, so let’s calculate this by hand! Honestly, without Wikipedia, I would have been stuck, but it turns out that we have a general formula for the gamma function in the form of $\\Gamma(n + \\frac{1}{4}) = \\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4}) \\frac{(4n - 3)!!!!}{4^n}$. However, what’s even nicer is that we can approximate: $\\frac{\\Gamma(n + \\frac{1}{4})}{\\Gamma(n)}$ by using $\\frac{\\Gamma(a + \\epsilon)}{\\Gamma(a)} \\approx \\left(a + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{\\epsilon}$. Hence, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma(366.25)}{\\Gamma(366)} \\approx \\left(366 + \\frac{0.25}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0.25} = \\left(366 + 0.125 - 0.5\\right)^{0.25} = \\left(365.625\\right)^{0.25}\n$$\nThis means the original expression can then be approximated as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma(366) \\Gamma(1.25)}{\\Gamma(366.25)} \\approx \\Gamma(1.25) \\left(365.625\\right)^{-0.25}\n$$\nNow by expanding out the gamma function $\\Gamma(\\frac{5}{4}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})$, we can calculate this as2:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma(366)\\Gamma(1.25)}{\\Gamma(366.25)} \\approx \\frac{\\Gamma(\\frac14)}{4 \\sqrt[4]{365.625}}\n$$\nNow, thanks to the work of others, we find that $\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4}) = 3.6256099082219083119$. This means we can calculate the probability of seeing all birthdays in a group of 365.25 students as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma(366)\\Gamma(1.25)}{\\Gamma(366.25)} \\approx 0.20728\n$$\nHell ya! Finally, we can calculate the expected number of students needed to see all birthdays in a group of 365.25 students as follows:\n$$\n2366 + 0.20728 \\cdot \\frac{365.25}{0.25} \\approx 2669\n$$\nWe can continue with this lead, but I want to explore another lead I have in mind for now – we’ll return to this later!\nThe Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nSo far, we’ve explored the Coupon Collector approach, which is a solid starting point. But now, let’s delve into a more powerful tool in combinatorics: the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. This is the very method that the person who responded on Fizz used! It’s a fascinating approach, particularly useful for counting the number of elements in the union of several sets, even when those sets are not disjoint.\n\n“Do you think it’s likely that a collection of Rice University students would include at least one student with each possible birthday? How can we calculate the probability that every birthday is represented assuming uniform distribution?” \n— Problem 1.2\n\nIn other words, we want to find the probability that at least one student has each birthday. In fact, this is the reverse of asking if nobody has a birthday on those days, which is easier to calculate (I’ll explain in a bit). We can use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to calculate the probability that nobody has a birthday on a particular day! The inclusion principle states that if we have events $A_i, i = { 1, 2, \\ldots, n}$ and $\\mathcal{P}(A_i)$ is the probability of event $A_i$. The probability of the union of their union (i.e., the likelihood that at least one of the events occurs) is given by:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathcal{P}(A_i)\\ - \\sum_{1\\leq i&lt;j\\leq n} \\mathcal{P}(A_i \\cap A_j) \\\\\n&amp;+ \\quad \\sum_{1\\leq i&lt;j&lt;k\\leq n}\\mathcal{P}(A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k) - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} \\mathcal{P}( A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n) \\\\\n&amp;= \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq {1,2,\\ldots ,n}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nThe intuitive way to think about the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle is as a method for correcting overcounts when calculating the probability of at least one of several events occurring. In the context of our problem with Rice University students, each event $A_i$ can be thought of as the event that no student has their birthday on day $i$. Since these events overlap (students can share birthdays or not have birthdays on multiple specific days), we need to adjust for the overlap to avoid double-counting the probabilities. Now, before we use it, however, let’s prove it and a claim that will be useful for our proof.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Proof of Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Proof: We proceed by the principle of induction. Let’s denote the principle as\n$$\np(n) = \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq {1,2,\\ldots ,n}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}\\right), n \\in \\mathbb{N}, |A_i| = n, n \\geq 2\n$$\nBase Case: For $n = 2$, let us denote $A_1 = E$ and $A_2 = F$. Then, observe that $E$ and $F-E$ are exclusive events, which means that their union $\\mathcal{P}(E \\cup F) = \\mathcal{P}(E \\cup (F - E)) = \\mathcal{P}(E) + \\mathcal{P}(F - E)$. Moreover, we also know that $F-E$  and $F \\cup E$ are exclusive events with their union being $F$. Hence, we can write $\\mathcal{P}(F)$ $= \\mathcal{P}((F - E) \\cup (F \\cap E)) = \\mathcal{P}(F - E) + \\mathcal{P}(F \\cap E)$. Thus:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{P}(E \\cup F) &amp;= \\mathcal{P}(E) + \\mathcal{P}(F - E)\\\\\n&amp;= \\mathcal{P}(E) + \\left(\\mathcal{P}(F) - \\mathcal{P}(E \\cap F)\\right)\\\\\n&amp;= \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq {1,2}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nWhere the second line follows from the fact that $E \\cap F = E$ and $F - E = F$. To read the last line notice that the non-empty subsets of $J$ are $\\{1, 2\\}$, $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, so the summation is $\\mathcal{P}(E) + \\mathcal{P}(F) - \\mathcal{P}(E \\cap F)$; the base case holds.\nInductive Step: Assume that $p(k)$ holds for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we show that $p(k+1)$ holds. Let $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{k+1}$ be events, then we can write:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k+1} A_i \\right) &amp;= \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\left[\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} A_i \\right] \\cup A_{k+1} \\right)&amp; &amp;\\text{by definition}\\\\\n&amp;= \\mathcal{P}\\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} A_i \\right) + \\mathcal{P}(A_{k+1}) - \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\left[\\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} A_i \\right] \\cap A_{k+1} \\right)&amp; &amp;\\text{base case with } E = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} A_i, F = A_{k+1}\\\\\n&amp;= \\mathcal{P}\\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} A_i \\right) + \\mathcal{P}(A_{k+1}) - \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} \\left(A_i \\cap A_{k+1}\\right) \\right)&amp; &amp;\\text{by distributive property}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nNotice that the first and last terms are $n-$unions, thus the inductive hypothesis holds:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k+1} A_i \\right) &amp;= \\mathcal{P}\\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} A_i \\right) + \\mathcal{P}(A_{k+1}) - \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} \\left(A_i \\cap A_{k+1}\\right) \\right)&amp; &amp;\\\\\n&amp;= \\left[\\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq {1,2,\\ldots ,k}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}\\right)\\right] + \\mathcal{P}(A_{k+1})&amp; &amp; \\\\\n&amp;- \\left[\\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq {1,2,\\ldots ,k}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\mathcal{P}\\left(\\bigcap_{j\\in J} \\left(A_{j} \\cap A_{k+1}\\right)\\right)\\right]&amp; &amp;\\text{by inductive hypothesis}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nNow, observe:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}(A_{k+1}) = \\sum_{\\substack{J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k+1} \\ k+1 \\in J, |J|=1}} (-1)^{|J|-1} \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in J} A_j \\right)\n$$\nAnd for the terms with intersections $ A_j \\cap A_{k+1} $:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in J} (A_j \\cap A_{k+1}) \\right) = \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in (J \\cup {k+1})} A_j \\right)\n$$\nThus, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k+1} A_i \\right) &amp;= \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k}} (-1)^{|J|-1} \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in J} A_j \\right) \\\\\n&amp;\\quad + \\sum_{\\substack{J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k+1} \\ k+1 \\in J, |J|=1}} (-1)^{|J|-1} \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in J} A_j \\right) \\\\\n&amp;\\quad - \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k}} (-1)^{|J|-1} \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in (J \\cup {k+1})} A_j \\right)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nCombining all these terms, I claim we have $(\\star)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k+1} A_i \\right) = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J’ \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k+1}} (-1)^{|J’|-1} \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in J’} A_j \\right)\\quad (\\star)\n$$\nAll that is left is proving $(\\star)$, but it’s not that important for the reader.\n\nProof of $(\\star)$\n\nLet $E = { J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k} \\mid J \\neq \\emptyset }$ and $F = { J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k+1} \\mid J \\neq \\emptyset }$. Then, $F - E = { {k+1} } \\cup { {k+1} \\cup x \\mid x \\in E }$.\nTo prove the claim, we need to show that every element $y$ in $F - E$ is in ${ {k+1} } \\cup { {k+1} \\cup x \\mid x \\in E }$ and vice versa. Suppose $y \\in F - E$. This means $y \\in F$ and $y \\notin E$. Since $y \\in F$, we have $y \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k+1}$ and $y \\neq \\emptyset$. Additionally, $y \\notin E$ implies $y \\not\\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k}$. This means there exists an element $m \\in y$ such that $m \\notin {1, 2, \\ldots, k}$. The only such $m$ is $k+1$, so $k+1 \\in y$.\nConsider two cases: $y = {k+1}$ or $y \\supset {k+1}$, i.e., $y = {k+1} \\cup x$ for some $x \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k}$. In the second case, since $y \\notin E$, $x \\neq \\emptyset$, implying $x \\in E$. Thus, $y \\in { {k+1} } \\cup { {k+1} \\cup x \\mid x \\in E }$.\nConversely, suppose $y \\in { {k+1} } \\cup { {k+1} \\cup x \\mid x \\in E }$. This means either $y = {k+1}$ or $y = {k+1} \\cup x$ for some $x \\in E$. In both cases, $y \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k+1}$ and $y \\neq \\emptyset$, so $y \\in F$. Additionally, $y \\notin E$ because if $y = {k+1}$, clearly $y \\not\\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, k}$, and if $y = {k+1} \\cup x$ and $x \\in E$, $y$ contains $k+1$ which is not in ${1, 2, \\ldots, k}$. Hence, $y \\in F - E$.\nCombining both directions, we have shown $F - E = { {k+1} } \\cup { {k+1} \\cup x \\mid x \\in E }$. This completes the proof of $(\\star)$.\n\n\nEquivalently, we can express $J’$ as $J’ = (J \\cup { \\{k+1\\} } \\cup \\{ \\{k+1\\} \\cup x \\mid x \\in J \\})$ through our claim. This completes the inductive step; thus, through the principle of induction, we have proven the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, $p(n)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\n\n    \n  \n\nThat took a bit, but now we can use it freely 😎! Fix $n$, the number of students, and let $m$ be a set of birthdays. Clearly, for a set of $m$ days, the probability that nobody has a birthday on those days is $(1 - \\frac{m}{365})^n$. Now to tie this to the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, we need to state a corollary 🙃:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Corollary of IEP\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Corollary: In the probabilistic version of the inclusion-exclusion principle, the probability of the intersection $A_i, i \\in I$ only depends on the cardinality of $I$, meaning for every $k \\in {1, \\ldots, n}$, there exists $a_k$ such that\n$$\na_k = \\mathcal{P}(A_I) \\quad \\text{for every} \\quad I \\subseteq {1, \\ldots, n} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad |I| = k\n$$\nThen, the formula simplifies to\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n}{k} a_k\n$$\nThis result arises due to the combinatorial interpretation of the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ and the independence of the events $A_i$.\n\nProof of Corollary\n \nLet’s denote the probability of the union of $n$ events $A_i$ as $\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right)$. According to the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, n}} (-1)^{|J|-1} \\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcap_{j \\in J} A_j \\right)\n$$\nGiven that the probability of the intersection $A_i$ only depends on the cardinality of $I$, we let $a_k = \\mathcal{P}(A_I)$ for any $I$ with $|I| = k$. We can then rewrite the inclusion-exclusion formula as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\sum_{\\substack{J \\subseteq {1, 2, \\ldots, n} \\ |J| = k}} (-1)^{k-1} a_k\n$$\nSince there are $\\binom{n}{k}$ subsets $J$ of size $k$ from $n$ elements, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n}{k} a_k\n$$\nFor the case where the events $A_i$ are independent and identically distributed, we have $\\mathcal{P}(A_i) = p$ for all $i$, and thus $a_k = p^k$. Substituting $a_k = p^k$ into the formula, we get:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \\binom{n}{k} p^k\n$$\nWhich completes the proof of the corollary. $$\n\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}\n$$\n\n\n    \n  \n\nUsing the corollary, we can finally calculate the probability our question asks for! Let $A_i$ be the event that nobody has a birthday on day $i$, then the probability that at least one student has each birthday is given by:\n$$\n\\sum_{m=0}^{365} (-1)^m \\binom{365}{m} \\left(1 - \\frac{m}{365}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{365^n} \\sum_{m=0}^{365} (-1)^m \\binom{365}{m} (365 - m)^n\n$$\nNow, we can calculate this for $n = 2366$ and $n = 2669$ to see if our results match up!\n\nWe end up with $n = 2366$ having a probability of $0.573$ and $n = 2669$ having a probability of $0.785$. This is a bit surprising, as the expected number of students needed to see all birthdays was $2366$ students, but the likelihood of seeing all birthdays was only $57.3%$ using that number. This is because the expected number of students needed to see all birthdays is the average number of students needed to see all birthdays. Still, the probability of seeing all birthdays is one minus the probability of not seeing all birthdays. This subtle but essential distinction shows the power of different probability theory methods (and leads)!\nMonte Carlo Simulation\nNow that we have come up with two different methods to solve similar problems, I want to explore another lead: Monte Carlo Simulation (honestly, so this blog has pictures, lol). Monte Carlo simulations are beneficial when dealing with complex probability problems. Instead of solving the problem analytically, we often simulate the scenario and observe the outcomes. In our case, we will simulate the assignment of birthdays to students repeatedly and count how often all 365 days are represented. Unfortunately, we must move to the computing land and code it up. I wanted an easy, fast, and clean language to prototype this, so, of course, I chose rust 🦀\nSince this is a math blog, I’ll keep the code to a minimum. The concept is straightforward: we assign a random birthday to each student and check if all 365 days are represented. We repeat this process numerous times and calculate the probability of seeing all birthdays. To optimize our models for the problem, I’ve decided to create an interface for our simulations (or a trait in Rust land):\n\nThis will allow us to create different models for our simulations, such as a simple model randomly assigning birthdays to students and two more I have in mind. Here is our first model:\n\nIn this model, we generate a random birthday for each student and check if all 365 days are represented through a hash set. We repeat this process many times and calculate the probability of seeing all birthdays. We then get the likelihood of seeing all birthdays for each number of students in our students array. Now, we run the code with cargo run --release:\n\nHere are the results:\n\nAnyway, I wanted to make this fast enough to run more simulations, so here is a slightly optimized version of the model where we parallelize the simulation. Parallelizing is a technique that allows us to run multiple computations simultaneously, which can be useful when we have a large number of simulations to run, as in this case!\n\nNow, let’s change the main function and the number of simulations to run 100,000 simulations and test the models:\n\nSurprisingly, it only took 2m 40s for both models to run $100000$ simulations, which is pretty fast! Here are the results again:\n\nClearly, paralleling the model was worth it. In either case, we see that using a Monte Carlo simulation, we can get a good approximation of the probability of seeing all birthdays in a group of students. I don’t like computation, but you gotta admit, this is cool as it matches our work so far! But now, let’s move on to the proof of3—jk the third model and pretty pictures!\nThe IEP model and plots!\nLet’s move on to the third model, which uses the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Since the IEP is deterministic, we don’t need to run simulations. Instead, we can calculate the probability of seeing all birthdays in a group of students directly. Here is the code for the model:\n\nRunning the model, we get the following results:\n\nWOW, the IEP model is super fast and accurate! It makes sense since it’s a formula, but I expected something other than $73$ms. With that being said, let’s make some pretty graphs :). First, since this is an exploration, I’ll show the trace graphs of the models (I think it’s really cool). To make these graphs, I used env CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=true cargo flamegraph --root -o flamegraph.svg with the flamegraph crate. You can right-click and open these images in a new tab to explore their traces!\nThe basic model:\n\nThe parallel model:\n\nThe IEP model:\n\nNow, let’s plot the results4 of the parallel and IEP model to see how they compare. To make these graphs prettier, I decided to map over a range of students, 0 to 9,000, and to run only 10,000 simulations.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Code to generate plots\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      First, here is the rust code I used to write the data.\n\nHere is the python code to generate the plots.\n\n\n    \n  \n\nNow, here are our plots:\n\n\n\nI like graphs because they help us visualize the data and see patterns that might not be immediately obvious from the numbers. In this case, we can see that the IEP model is much faster than the parallel model and that the probability of seeing all birthdays increases as the number of students increases. The violin plot also shows the distribution of probabilities for each model, with the IEP model having a narrower distribution than the parallel model. Finally, we can see that IEP scales linearly with the number of students, while the parallel model scales exponentially. Now, let’s move on to our final section and last model!\nI read a paper and found…\nHonestly, I was going to call it a day because although I said we would explore the original question, I didn’t know how to account for the fact that birthdays are not uniformly distributed. I had an idea on how to get the actual probabilities, and the last model (soon btw) was going to implement this based on data I got, but it felt like a cop-out. Or at least it was until I found a paper!\nFirst, let’s talk about the assumptions we made. The most important thing to note is that birthdays are not uniformly distributed. The most famous blog about this can be found here by Roy Murphy. For instance, according to the data he collected, August is the most common month to have a birthday. This means that the probability of seeing all birthdays in a group of students is not simply $1 - \\frac{m}{365}$, but rather a more complex function that depends on the distribution of birthdays. Moreover, Rice is a specific group of the general population, so it could have a different distribution of birthdays than the general population. It might be possible to answer the question well if I got specific data like zip code and birthdate, but due to ethical reasons, I totally don’t have that data. So that was a dead end — until I found this paper,  Birthday paradox, coupon collectors, caching algorithms and self-organizing search by Philippe Flajolet.\nSo I read the paper (I totally didn’t just read the part that was relevant to my problem 🤧), and it turns out the Coupon Collector’s Problem can be generalized to non-uniform distributions. Specifically, in Theorem $4.1$, Dr. Flajolet gives us the equation:\n$$\nE(T) = \\int_0^\\infty \\left(1 - \\prod_{i=1}^m (1 - e^{-p_i t}) \\right) dt.\n$$\nThis is equal to\n$$\nE(T) = \\sum_{q=0}^{m-1} (-1)^{m-1-q} \\sum_{|J|=q} \\frac{1}{1 - P_J},\n$$\nWhere $ m $ denotes the number of coupons to be collected, and $ P_J $ denotes the probability of getting any coupon in the set of coupons $ J $. Let’s prove this!\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Proof of Theorem 4.1\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      I lied to you. While I did understand Dr. Flajolet’s general proof, I am not confident I can provide a great proof here. However, he used generating functions to generalize the Coupon Collector’s Problem to non-uniform distributions, and it’s pretty cool! In either case, if you want proof, please read the paper!\n\n    \n  \n\nWith the proof finished 😎, we will allow ourselves to use the theorem. Moreover, we will implement this as our last model. Let’s first talk about the data to generate the probabilities. The SSA (Social Security Administration) records birthdays in the US. Since we want to talk about Rice students, I got the data for 2002 to 2005 (sorry super seniors). I found this data here. Calculating the probabilities for each day was easy:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Code to calculate probabilities\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Note that the original version of this had an error, I have corrected it here. The error was in the day_of_year function, which was not correctly calculating the day of the year standardly.\n\n\n    \n  \n\nNow, we just gotta implement the formula to get the expected number of students needed to see all birthdays given the data from 2002 to 2005:\n\nNow, all we have to do is modify our main function to run the Flajolet model and plot the results:\n\nAfter I ran it, I found the actual expected number of Rice Owls needed to see all birthdays, including leap days and real birthday distributions, was:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Final Answer\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      I lied naturally as I breathed. Look, honestly, I ran the model, but there is a huge problem! Let’s take a look:\n\nWhich is supposed to implement this part of the formula:\n$$\n\\sum_{|J|=q} \\frac{1}{1 - P_J}\n$$\nIf you know anything about computational complexity, you will immediately realize the problem: combinatorial explosion. The number of subsets of a set of size $n$ is $2^n$, so the number of subsets of a set of size $366$ is $2^{366}$. This is a huge number, and even after all my clever optimizations (I tried, really), the model won’t ever end. I tried it for a small number of days, and it worked as per my calculations; however, the universe would end before I got the answer for $366$ days. So, I am sorry, but I can’t give you the final answer because I will die before I get it. In a way, that’s motivation, honestly. If the $P = NP$ problem is solved, then we can come back to this problem knowing there might be a polynomial time solution. But until then, we need to be content with an approximation.\n\n    \n  \n\nWith that, we finally have a good enough answer to our original question 😉! I hope you enjoyed this exploration, and I hope you learned something new. Before we conclude, I wanted to compare an informed Monte Carlo simulation with the parallel model assuming equal probabilities for 366 days. I will use the probabilities we calculated from the data to run the simulation.\nOne Last Time: Informed Monte Carlo Simulation\nSince we have the data, we can use the probabilities to make a more informed Monte Carlo simulation. I will use the same model as the parallel model, but instead of assuming equal probabilities for each day, I will use the probabilities we calculated from the data. Here is the code for the model:\n\nNow, that we are done with everything. I’d like to show you why I implemented the Simulation trait:\n\nSee! We can easily run all the models and compare them (even if some won’t ever finish) and another pretty plot:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Code to generate plots\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n\n    \n  \n\nThat said, we are at the end of our journey. In the end, we found a formula that works, but the power of today’s computation is holding me back 😔. While that may disappoint you, the reader, I know how to fix it: give me a polynomial time equation, and I’ll be back with an exact answer 😎. Anyways, I hope everything was clear; I tried my best. If you see any mistakes, know it’s not me who made a mistake; it’s you who needs a check-up/s (email me at seniormars@rice.edu or write a comment below). Have a great year!\nAnd then, the Physicst attacked\nSometimes, theory can only get us so far (please imagine me saying this while sobbing 😭😭😭). As a math major, I have always been told to pursue the idea of rigorousness, but we NEED an answer. I can’t provide that; however, I know someone who can. A physicist – one that is armed with computational tricks and pragmatism. Enter Wisha, a rising senior, a rustacean, and Rice’s best physicist5. Overhearing my frustration with the birthday problem, he decided to take matters into his own hands. He has given me a solution, and now it is my job to wrap his argument into a neat little package!\nRevisiting our formula\nRemember, we found that a generalized Coupon Collector’s Problem that assumes non-uniform distributions, however, for large $m$ ($366$ in our case), the formula Dr. Flajolet gave us is computationally infeasible. That being said, let’s take a closer look at the the first version of the formula:\n$$\nE(T) = \\int_0^\\infty \\left(1 - \\prod_{i=1}^m (1 - e^{-p_i t}) \\right) \\textrm{dt}.\n$$\nTo be finished…\nConclusion\nThroughout this article, I came to realize that I hate stats. Thank you fizz, I’ll probably deregister from MATH 412: Probability Theory now. On a serious note, writing for a public audience – especially for math – is incredibly hard. If you read up to this point, I hope you enjoyed it.\n\n\n\nThis is a very easy proof, so let’s do it.

Why do we do this? Once a result is proven, it’s settled, right? Well, not quite.\nMathematics isn’t just about knowing whether something is true—it’s about understanding why it’s true. And as it turns out, different proofs often provide different insights. But what if there’s more? What if there exists an optimal proof—a proof that, in some sense, is the best?\nThat’s where complexity theory comes in. And before you say, “But I’m not a computer scientist!”, let’s talk about why you, as a mathematician, should care. I was specifically inspired to make this blog by a thread I saw on Reddit, but I wanted to go into more detail about my thoughts.\nProofs Are Programs: The Curry-Howard Lens\nOne of the most important ideas in mathematical logic is that proofs can be viewed as programs. The Curry-Howard correspondence tells us:\n\nA theorem is a type.\nA proof is a program.\nProof normalization is computation.\n\nFrom this perspective, every proof we construct is not just a verification of truth—it’s a computational object. And like any computational object, we can ask: how efficient is it?\nFor example, if two different proofs of a theorem correspond to two different algorithms, then one might be more efficient than the other. A proof that constructs a witness explicitly (a constructive proof) might yield an algorithm that runs in polynomial time, while a proof relying on non-constructive methods might encode an exponential search.\nAnd this isn’t just theoretical. Gödel himself saw this connection.\nGödel, von Neumann, and the Birth of Complexity\nIn 1956, Gödel wrote a letter to von Neumann that, in retrospect, essentially anticipated complexity theory before it existed. He asked:\n\n“One can obviously easily construct a Turing machine, which for every formula\nF in first order predicate logic and every natural number n, allows one to\ndecide if there is a proof of F of length n. The question is how fast φ(n)\ngrows for an optimal machine.”\n\nGödel goes on to speculate about the implications if certain mathematical problems could be solved much more efficiently than by exhaustive search:\n\n“It would obviously mean that in spite of the undecidability of the\nEntscheidungsproblem, the mental work of a mathematician concerning Yes-or-No\nquestions could be completely replaced by a machine.”\n\nClearly, Gödel was asking something fundamental: Is there a way to measure the complexity of mathematical thought and be able to automate it?\nHe was, in essence, formulating what we now recognize as the $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}$ problem. If a proof (or algorithm) exists for a problem, how efficiently can we find it? This directly impacts how we think about proofs: If an optimal proof of a theorem exists, how complex is it? How long does it take to verify? Can we systematically find short proofs?\nA Theorem Is an Equivalence Class of Proofs\nIf there is one thing, I want you to take away from this blog, it’s this:\n\n“A theorem is an equivalence class of all its proofs.”\n\nThis is a profound way to think about mathematical truth. A theorem isn’t just a single fact—it’s the collection of all possible ways to derive it. Each proof offers a different perspective, a different computational structure, and sometimes, a different level of efficiency.\nThis explains why we care about multiple proofs:\n\nThey expose new techniques that can be applied elsewhere.\nThey show connections between different areas of mathematics.\nThey reveal computational properties that might not be obvious from a single proof.\n\nProof Systems and Axiomatic Differences\nNow, we need to remember proofs don’t exist in isolation—they exist within proof systems, which determine what rules of inference are allowed. Different axiomatic systems can lead to different styles of proofs and even different results.\nIn some proof systems, a statement might have an elegant, short proof, while in others, it might require pages of complex derivations. Consider (as expressed by Avi Wigderson in $\\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}$ and mathematics – a computational complexity perspective):\n\nHilbert’s Nullstellensatz: Theorems are inconsistent sets of polynomial equations. Proofs are linear combinations of polynomials.\nGroup theory: Theorems are words that reduce to the identity element. Proofs are sequences of substitutions.\nReidemeister moves in knot theory: Theorems are knots that can be unknotted. Proofs are sequences of diagram transformations.\nvon Neumann’s Minimax theorem: Theorems are optimal strategies in zero-sum games. Proofs are arguments showing the strategies are equivalent.\n\nEach proof system has its own complexity. Some proof systems require exponentially long proofs for certain theorems that are polynomial-length in others. This is one reason why multiple proofs matter—switching proof systems can dramatically affect proof complexity.\nThe Pigeonhole Principle and Proof Complexity\nTo make this concrete, let’s consider a classic example: the pigeonhole principle.\nThe pigeonhole principle states that if you put more pigeons than pigeonholes (say, $ m $ pigeons into $ n $ holes with $ m &gt; n $), then at least one hole must contain multiple pigeons. Trivial, right? But proving this formally can be surprisingly difficult.\nDifferent proof systems encode this principle differently:\n\nAlgebraic proof: Using polynomials over $ GF(2) $.\nGeometric proof: Framing it as an optimization problem.\nLogical proof: Using Boolean formulas.\n\nEach of these proof techniques has different proof complexity. For example, in resolution proof systems (used in SAT solvers), the pigeonhole principle requires exponentially long proofs1. But in other systems, it might have polynomial-length proofs. What does this mean? It means that how we choose to prove a theorem can fundamentally affect its computational efficiency.\nThis is not just an esoteric fact. It’s a key issue in theoretical computer science: Do short proofs always exist? If $ \\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P} $, then very theorem with a short proof has a short proof that we can find efficiently. If $ \\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P} $, then some theorems may have short proofs that are computationally infeasible to discover.\nAre Some Proofs “Optimal”?\nIf every proof corresponds to an algorithm, we can ask whether there exists an optimal proof—the shortest, most efficient proof possible. For some theorems, we suspect there’s an inherent lower bound on proof length. In fact, many results in proof complexity are lower bound arguments: showing that some theorems require long proofs in certain systems.\nFor example:\n\nThe Paris-Harrington theorem, a finitary version of Ramsey’s theorem, cannot be proven in Peano arithmetic despite being a simple combinatorial statement2.\nThe Boolean formula complexity of pigeonhole principles suggests that some tautologies require exponentially long proofs in resolution-based proof systems.\n\nIf we had a general method to find the shortest proof of a theorem, we could answer fundamental questions in complexity theory. But this remains an open problem.\nConstructive vs. Non-Constructive Proofs\nOne of the most practical consequences of proof complexity is the difference between constructive and non-constructive proofs.\n\nA constructive proof explicitly produces a witness or an algorithm that establishes the truth of the theorem.\nA non-constructive proof shows that a solution must exist but does not necessarily give a method to find it.\n\nWhy does this distinction matter? Because constructive proofs often translate directly into implementable algorithms. If a proof is constructive, it tells us that something is true and gives us a way to compute it. In contrast, a non-constructive proof might establish existence without providing an efficient method of finding a solution.\nFor example, the Four Color Theorem was initially proven using a brute-force computer-assisted proof, verifying many cases without providing a human-comprehensible reason for why it holds. In contrast, many number-theoretic theorems have constructive proofs that immediately yield algorithms.\nThis distinction ties directly into complexity theory: If a problem is in $\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}$ , then we can verify solutions quickly—but can we find them efficiently? The existence of a solution does not imply that it can be computed in polynomial time.\nThe Computational Future of Proofs\nModern developments in automated theorem proving and interactive proof assistants are pushing mathematics toward a more computational paradigm. Proof assistants like Lean, Coq, and Isabelle formalize mathematical arguments as computational objects. And increasingly, mathematicians are using them.\nWhy should this matter? Because if proof search is a computational problem, then questions about proof efficiency become questions about algorithm design.\nMathematical proof isn’t just about verification—it’s about complexity. The length, structure, and computational cost of proofs aren’t just theoretical curiosities; they reflect fundamental limits of reasoning itself. And in an era where AI-assisted theorem proving is becoming practical, understanding proof complexity isn’t just a curiosity—it’s a necessity.\nConclusion\nSo, why do we seek multiple proofs of the same theorem? Not just for elegance. Not just for insight. But because proof complexity is real.\nMathematicians should care about proof complexity because:\n\nProofs encode computation, and different proofs reveal different computational efficiencies.\nGödel’s insight suggests that understanding proof complexity could help measure mathematical reasoning itself.\nIf $ \\mathcal{P} \\neq \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P} $, then some theorems have short proofs we can’t efficiently find—implying fundamental limits on mathematical knowledge.\n\nSo next time you see a new proof of a theorem, think of it not just as another way to see the truth—but as a different computational path, a different algorithm, and maybe, just maybe, a step toward an optimal proof.\nAnd if someone ever does prove $ \\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P} $, well… we might just be able to automate all of mathematics.\n\n\n\nCook, S.

For instance, if you want to\nuse Google domains, Google cloud’s APIs, or customize your Google security options, you are going to have a\nbad time. Don’t get me wrong, I understand why some of these rules are forced upon students, but\nprecisely because they are forced, I believe that there should be leeway for students that wish to\nopt out of the default settings. Now, this blog post won’t teach how to petition your university to\nrid of Google, but it will teach you how to set up a terminal alternative to Gmail (most notably\nthis blog is for college students that are forced to use Google’s email platform).\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      This blog assumes basic terminal maturity.  Moreover, this blog has now been updated to cover isync and more. See the update section near the end!\n\n    \n  \n\nNeomutt\nEnd Goal\nBefore I continue, I would like to show you what the result will look like:\n\nHere is an image with an email open:\n\nFinally, here is an image with a reply open (also s/crack/cracked):\n\nAt the end of this blog, I’ll show the configuration we came up with.\nIntroduction and WHY?\nOk, you have seen the images, but now you wonder: 1) what am I looking at? And 2) why would I want\nto use this? Let’s start with the first question. These images are of a terminal email client called\nNeomutt and it is my go-to email client. It supports all the basic email features that you would expect\nfrom an email client, plus way more! The second question is a bit more\ncomplex, as I cannot speak for everyone, but I will explain why I use Neomutt.\n\nAuto-image blocking: In the age where everyone is trying to get your attention, it is nice to have\na client that doesn’t render images by default. Instead of those annoying images, I get a plain\nview of the email, and concentrate on the content of the email.\nLightweight: Gmail is a resource hog. It takes seconds to load, and a\npain to use when you have a slow internet connection. Neomutt loads in a fraction of a second and\nallows you filter through your emails quickly.\nConfigurable: Neomutt is extremely configurable. You can change the color scheme, the keybindings,\nand even the email client’s behavior. For instance, In my current configuration, I have grammar\nchecking, auto-completion for words, and auto-completion for email addresses. Everything is done\nthrough the keyboard.\n\nNow, if none of these reasons appeal to you, then Neomutt is not for you. Click the back button.\nBut, if you are still here, then let’s get started!\nInstallation\nFor this blog, I’ll be detailing the installation process for Arch Linux, Gentoo, Ubuntu, and macOS.\nSince I know these distributions extremely well, I can provide more detailed instructions. If\nyou are using Windows, I recommend using WSL2, and you can follow along with the Ubuntu instructions.\nmacOS\nI’ll be using Homebrew to install Neomutt:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      $ is the prompt for a user without root access. You don’t need to type it.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nArch Linux\n\nGentoo\n\nUbuntu and WSL2 using Ubuntu\n\nRunning Neomutt for the first time\nThe first time you run Neomutt, you will be greeted with a screen that looks like this that prompts\nyou for your email address and password:\n\nThis is the default configuration that Neomutt comes with, but not very useful. We need to customize it first.\nTo demonstrate how to configure Neomutt, I’ll have two code blocks for each section.\nThe first code block will be the configuration that I use, and the second code block is the one you\nshould modify to fit your needs.\nInitial Mutt Configuration\nWe are going to take configuration step by step. I will explain what each section does, and why.\nThe first we need to do is make a muttrc file. This file is where we will store all of our configuration.\nBy default, Neomutt will look for a file called muttrc in the following location: XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/muttrc.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is an environment variable that points to the location of your configuration files. Read more about it here.\n\n    \n  \n\nFor example, on my machine, the location of my muttrc file is ~/.config/mutt/muttrc.\nIf this file does not exist, then you can create it by running the following command:\n\nLet’s put a hold on this to introduce the next section:\nGoogle, Gmail, and App-specific passwords\nAs I said before, this blog is intended for students that are forced to use Google’s email platform. Which\nmeans I’ll be detailing how to configure Neomutt to work with Gmail. Thus, before we move any further, it is important to get an “app-specific password” from Google.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      An app-specific password is a password for applications that do not support 2-factor authentication or are considered ‘unsecure’. Google wants you to use Gmail &gt;:(\n\n    \n  \n\nTo get an app-specific password, follow these steps:\n\nGo to Google’s app-specific password page\nSign in with your Google account\nSelect “Mail” as the app or other and select “Other (custom name)” as the device. I use “Mutt” as\nthe name.\nClick “Generate” and copy the password that is generated. You will need this password later. Store\nit!\nProfit??!!!\n\nHere is a screenshot of the result:\n\nAccessing Gmail with Neomutt\nNow that we have an app-specific password, we can configure Neomutt to access Gmail. To accomplish this,\nlet’s open up our muttrc (i.e., $EDITOR XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/muttrc) file with our favorite editor. I’ll be using nvim for this blog, but\nyou can use any editor you want. Now, let’s add the following configuration to our muttrc file:\nMine:\n\nYours:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Plain text for passwords is a bad idea. See the encryption section of this blog.\n\n    \n  \n\nLet’s break down this section:\nFirst, it’s pretty self-explanatory for the first few lines, but for set smtp*, we need to\nexplain.\nset smtp_url is the URL that Neomutt will use to send emails. The format is as follows:\nsmtps://email@server:port. For Gmail, the server is smtp.gmail.com and the port is 465. This\nis from the Gmail SMTP server documentation.\nset smtp_authenticators is the authentication method that Neomutt will use to send emails. For\nGmail, we will use gssapi:login as the authentication method.\nset imap_pass and set smtp_pass are the passwords that Neomutt will use to access your email.\nNote this is plaintext, we will fix this later.\nset ssl_starttls and set ssl_force_tls are used to ensure that Neomutt uses TLS when connecting\nto the server. This is important because Gmail will not allow you to connect to the server without\nthese properties.\nAfter you have added this configuration to your muttrc file, save it, and in theory, you\ncan now access your email! But, there are a few more things we need to do to make this more useful.\nMailboxes\nThe next step is to specify which mailboxes you want to access. To achieve this, we add:\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nset folder is the folder that Neomutt will use to access your emails. 993 is just the port for imap.\nset spoolfile is your home inbox. This is the inbox that you see when you log into Gmail. You\ncan change this to whatever you want. i.e., set spoolfile = \"+Important\". I like to see all my\nemails, so I use +All Mail.\nset record, set postponed, and set trash are the folders that Neomutt will use to store\nemails that you have sent, drafts, and trash respectively in Gmail.\nmailboxes is a list of mailboxes that you want to access. You can add as many as you want, but I\nkeep it simple with just the ones I use.\nset header_cache and set message_cachedir are the locations that Neomutt will use to cache\nyour emails. This is important because it will make your email client much faster. set certificate_file is similar.\nunset record is used to disable the recording of sent emails. This is because Gmail already\nrecords sent emails, so we don’t need to do it twice.\n\nAt this point, you should be able to access your email! Now, let’s make this even more useful.\nSettings I highly recommend\nAlright, so now that we have a basic configuration, but what about modifying how we reply to emails,\nor how we interact with our email client? Let’s add the following to our muttrc file:\nI added comments to explain what each line does.\n\nI highly recommend these settings, but you may want to change askcc, edit_headers, fast_reply, envelope_from.\nSidebar\nThe sidebar is a very useful feature that allows you to see all your mailboxes in a sidebar. Here is\na screenshot of what it looks like:\n\nHere is how to add it to your muttrc file:\n\nNow, you should be able to see the sidebar when you open your email client and press &lt;shift-b&gt; to toggle it!\nSignature\nThe signature is the text that you add to the bottom of your emails. To add it to Neomutt, you need\nto:\n\nCreate a file (call it signature or whatever you prefer)\nAdd your signature to the file. For example, here is mine:\n\n\n\nlink the file to your muttrc file:\n\n\nNow, when you send an email, your signature will be added to the bottom of the email.\nEditor\nThe editor is the program that you use to compose emails. By default, Neomutt uses vi as the editor, but you can change this to whatever you want. For instance, I use nvim as my editor, so I add the following to my muttrc file:\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      In (Neo)Vim with patch 6e649224926b and partial 113cb513f76d now include mail.vim, which is a filetype plugin for mail. This plugin provides syntax highlighting, indentation, and other features for mail files.\n\n    \n  \n\n(N)vim and Mail\nIf you use nvim as your editor, you may want to add the following to your nvim/after/ftplugin/mail.{lua,vim} file:\nLua:\n\nVim:\n\nThese settings will enable spell checking, better paragraph wrapping, and &lt;leader&gt;x will save and quit.\nKeybindings\nI highly recommend adding the following keybindings to your muttrc file for more vim-like keybindings:\n\nThe first marco isn’t very vim-like, but it is very useful. It allows you to mark all new emails as read by pressing A in the index.\nThe next set of keybindings are for scrolling. I use j and k to scroll up and down, and g and G to go to the top and bottom of the page.\nMailcap\nThe mailcap file is used to determine how to open attachments. For instance, if you have a .pdf\nfile, you would want to open it with your prefer PDF viewer. This is most useful for rendering HTML\nin emails.\n\nCreate a file called mailcap in your $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt directory.\nAdd the following to the file:\n\n\nOf course, you can change the browser, and pdf viewer to whatever you want. On Mac, you might want\nopen -a firefox %s or open -a Preview %s.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Firefox now supports editing PDFs!\n\n    \n  \n\n\nNow install lynx\n\nmacOS\n\nArch Linux\n\nGentoo\n\nUbuntu\n\n\nLink the file to your muttrc file and add the following to your muttrc file:\n\n\nYou can see more mailcap examples in my dotfiles here.\nNow you should be able to open attachments with your prefered program and automatically render HTML in emails! NO PICTURES THOUGH :)\nColors\nYou can change the colors of Neomutt by adding the following to your muttrc file:\n\nMy theme can be found here.\nExternal programs\nWhile, Neomutt is a great email client, it is not perfect. For instance, it doesn’t have a built-in\nquery support, urls are not clickable, and it doesn’t encrypt emails. To resolve these issues, we can\nuse external programs.\nUrlscan\nLet’s take a look at the first issue: urls are not clickable. To fix this, we can use urlscan to make urls clickable.\nThe GitHub repo for urlscan is here, and you can install it\nvia pip:\n\nNow, we need to add the following to our muttrc file:\n\nNow, when you press &lt;Ctrl+b&gt; in the index or pager, urlscan will be called and the urls will be\nextracted. You can then press &lt;Enter&gt; to open the url in your browser.\nSee image below:\n\nQuery\nThe next issue is that Neomutt doesn’t have a built-in query support. To fix this, we can use\ngoobook to search our contacts or lbdbq to use apple’s address book.\nFor goobook, I recommend looking at archlinux’s wiki for more information. It basically comes down to getting a token from Google.\nSince, I currently use macOS, I will show you how to use lbdbq to search my contacts.\n\nInstall lbdbq:\n\n\n\nModify lbdbq’s config file (either $HOME/.lbdbrc or /opt/homebrew/Cellar/lbdb/0.51.1/etc/lbdb.rc) to include the following:\n\n\nYou are done!\n\nAdd the following to your muttrc file:\n\n\nNow, when you press &lt;Tab&gt; in the editor when prompted for an email, you will be able to search your MacBook contacts!\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      You can add your Google contacts to your MacBook contacts by linking your Google account to your MacBook contacts. Which is not great, but I still did it.\n\n    \n  \n\nEncrypt\nI use gpg to encrypt my emails. This is very useful for GitHub, and other services that require security. This is especially useful on mailing lists where you need to verify information. I find that everyone in the Arch Linux Mailing list uses it!\n\nWe already installed gpg in the beginning, so we are good to go!\nCreate a key and follow the instructions that are prompted:\n\n\n\nCopy your public key:\n\n\nFor instance, my public key is: 7C668A6D13D5729989FB126B183357B41320BB2B. You can see the full\nversion here: https://github.com/SeniorMars.gpg\n\nAdd the following to your muttrc file:\n\n\n\nPlaintext is a bad idea, which is why we are going to use GPG to encrypt our passwords.\n\nIn your muttrc delete the following lines:\n\nNow go to your terminal and create a file called passwords in your muttrc directory and add\nthe lines you just deleted.\nNow, encrypt the file:\n\nYou should end up with a file called passwords.gpg in your muttrc directory.\nNow, add the following to your muttrc file:\n\nRemove the plaintext passwords file.\n\nNow, you have encrypted your passwords!\nImage below (notice the Good signature and  The following data is signed):\n\nAnd that’s it! You should now have a fully functional email client!\nUpdate\nNew Tools\nRecently, I have changed my setup to use isync and msmtp to handle my email. Before this (and the original blog), we needed to have an open connection to Gmail to check for new emails. This was not ideal, as it would prevent us from reaching the speeds that neomutt can reach. Now, with isync and msmtp, I can browse my emails locally and only connect to Gmail when I want to send an email. This is awesome if you aim to limit your connection to Gmail.\nisync\nisync is a command-line tool that synchronizes your mailbox in a local directory with a remote IMAP server, allowing you to manage your email locally. This is particularly beneficial for users who prefer not to maintain a constant connection to their email server.\nInstallation\nAs isync requires a constant connection to your email server, you need to again create an app-specific password from google. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see the Google, Gmail, and App-specific passwords section.\nmacOS\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Correct Mac Installation\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      All of this info comes from the com4.\n\nChange libtoolize to glibtoolize, otherwise you’ll get a libtoolize not found error. I’m unsure if this warrants a patch.\n\nThen we run the command as normal:\n\nNow we need to install isync properly.  Add , \"--with-sasl=/opt/homebrew/opt/cyrus-sasl\" to the ./configure line in the def install section.  Add a depends_on \"cyrus-sasl\" below depends_on \"openssl@3\" but I’m unsure if this is required since it was manually installed. Here is the diff to isync.rb\n\nFinally, we can install isync:\n\nOr if you are using fish:\n\nThis should work! I know this is a mess but it works!\n\n    \n  \n\nArch Linux\n\nGentoo\n\nUbuntu and WSL2 using Ubuntu\n\nConfiguring isync\nTo start, you need to create a configuration file for isync, typically named .mbsyncrc in your home directory:\n\nHere’s an example configuration that you might use for Gmail (note that isync.gpg is a file that contains your GPG-encrypted password for isync):\n\nHere is my configuration:\n\nThis configuration tells isync to sync your Gmail’s INBOX to a local directory. It uses GPG to decrypt your password securely.\nRunning isync\nTo sync your mail, simply run:\n\nThis command will sync all channels defined in your .mbsyncrc file and download your emails to your local machine.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Homebrew provides a service to run mbsync every 15 minutes.\nYou can enable this by running brew services start isync.\n\n    \n  \n\nNeomutt integration\nNow that you have isync set up, you can configure Neomutt to use the local mail directory to read your emails. To do this, you need to modify your muttrc file:\n\nNotice that we changed the mbox_type to Maildir and set the folder to the path where isync stores your emails. This will allow Neomutt to read your emails from the local directory. Now, the next time you open Neomutt, it will be a bit slow, but after that, it will be lightning fast!\nmsmtp\nmsmtp is a simple SMTP client that allows you to send emails from your local computer. When paired with isync, it handles the sending of emails, completing your email setup to work both offline and online. Additionally, you can set up msmtp for multiple email accounts, making it a versatile tool for managing your emails.\nInstallation\nmacOS\n\nArch Linux\n\nGentoo\n\nUbuntu and WSL2 using Ubuntu\n\nConfiguring msmtp\nCreate a configuration file for msmtp in your home directory:\n\nHere’s a basic configuration for Gmail (note that msmtp.gpg is a file that contains your GPG-encrypted password for Gmail):\n\nThis is my configuration:\n\nThis configuration will use your Gmail account to send emails through SMTP, using a password fetched securely using GPG.\nUsing msmtp\nTo send an email using msmtp, you can pipe the content of an email file like so:\n\nTo test you can run:\n\nYou should email me for fun: $ echo \"Hi SeniorMars!\" | msmtp -a default cjh16@rice.edu\nNeomutt integration\nTo integrate msmtp with Neomutt, you need to modify your muttrc file:\n\nThat’s it! Now, when you send an email in Neomutt, it will use msmtp to send the email.\nnotmuch\nnotmuch is an email indexing tool that provides fast searching capabilities. It is useful when dealing with large volumes of email, helping you to quickly find exactly what you need. Especially when paired with Neomutt and isync, notmuch can significantly improve your email workflow.\nInstallation\nmacOS\n\nArch Linux\n\nGentoo\n\nUbuntu and WSL2 using Ubuntu\n\nConfiguring notmuch\nFirst, initialize notmuch:\n\nFollow the prompts to set up your email directory (for me it is ~/.local/share/email/cjh16). Then, you can start searching your emails by using:\n\nNotmuch will index your emails located in the directory specified during setup, allowing you to use powerful search queries to navigate your mail efficiently.\nNeomutt integration\nTo integrate notmuch with Neomutt, you need to modify your muttrc file:\n\nThis will allow us to sync our emails and search our emails using notmuch directly from Neomutt. Pretty cool!\nThings left desired\nHonestly, I love my setup, but there could always be improvements. Notably:\n\nI want to not use app-specific passwords. I would like to use OAuth2, but my school blocks us from doing anything technical.\nI would like to auto complete email addresses from my contacts. I have a lot of contacts, and I don’t remember all of their emails.\nSometimes I want images lmao! I’ve been trying to mess around with Kitty but macos is a pain.\n\n\n\nI want to fix cache contact with lbdbq and notmuch. I have tried, but I can’t get it to work.\n\n\nThat being said, I am happy with my setup. I can send and receive emails, and I can search my emails quickly. I can also encrypt my emails, which is a plus.\nConclusion\nI hope you enjoyed this tutorial! If you have any questions, don’t ask /s.\nHere is my final configuration. And again, here is how my email client looks (lol taxes with github now):\n\nI am going to upload a talk I gave on setting up Neovim for non-programmers soon. This talks about\ngrammar checking, spell keybinds, and more. So stay tuned!\nThanks for reading and have a nice day!\nSeniorMars\n","description":"A guy decides that his email workflow is worth writing about.","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/neomutt/","path":"/posts/neomutt/","title":"A Terminal Email Client As An Alternative To Gmail: The Old Dog Neomutt And Pals"},"https://seniormars.com/posts/neovim-workflow/":{"body":"Motivation\nEver since TJ said “Personalized Development Environment,” the phrase latched onto me like a cobweb in a mineshaft. A Personalized Development Environment (PDE) describes an ideal setup that is tailored to your needs and preferences – it lies between a bare-bone text editor and a full-fledged IDE. It is a place where you can be productive, efficient, and comfortable. It is a place that suits you and only you.\nI started using Vim in my sophomore year of high school when my computer couldn’t run Visual Studio Code and Windows simultaneously, so the terminal (and Linux) became my home. I still remember my early days as a Linux user — filled with frustration, confusion, and much googling. I remember my computer being unable to connect to my printer because Linux didn’t have a patch yet. I remember the first time my bootloader was corrupted due to a Windows update, and I was praying I could still boot into my precious setup. I remember when I decided to delete Windows for good, but I forgot that I had mounted the partition and ended up nuking my hard drive. Going down this path means headaches, but it also means growth. It means learning how to fix your own problems and learning how to be self-sufficient.\nI cannot, in good faith, teach you how to debug every issue you will encounter (those errors will structure your ideal PDE), but I can inspire you and your setup. I am now going to be a junior in College, so I have had a few years to refine my setup, and I hope you do the same. I’ll show you the workflow that I have built over the years and how I have optimized it to be as efficient as possible. This is the way of SeniorMars; this is my way!\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Dotfiles\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      I know people will ask, so here they are: SeniorMars’ Dotfiles. Moreover, I will be assuming you are using Neovim 0.10!\nMoreover, throughout this I use lua to configure my Neovim, and use lazy.nvim to install and mange my plugins.\n\n    \n  \n\nImproving the (Neo)Vim Experience\nAlthough, I stated this was not for beginners, I still need to point out the fundamentals. Without these, I would not consider neovim to even approach the basics of a PDE. If you think this is too basic, then you can skip this section – I promise you will learn something.\nSearch and Replace\nLet’s first start with something simple, so you get a taste on what kind of tips I will be giving you.\n\nThe first two options are self-explanatory. ignorecase makes search case-insensitive, and smartcase makes search case-sensitive if you use a capital letter. The third option is where the magic happens. Ever since, I first learned of incsearch, I have been in love. incsearch highlights the search pattern as you type it, giving you a real-time preview of where your pattern matches. The magic doesn’t stop at highlighting, though; by setting inccommand to split, we have a preview of what our substitution will look like.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nNow, let’s move on to keybindings.\n\nMoreover, when I know I want to rename a variable, I do the following:\n\nPlace my cursor on the variable I would like to rename.\nUse the keybinding * in normal mode to highlight all instances of the variable.\nDo cgn to change the word under the cursor and move to the next instance.\nPress . to repeat the change on the next instance.\n\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nNow, for some plugins.\n\nThis allows me to use rg to search for a word under the cursor, search for a word in the current director, and search for a word in the current directory. Grepper Operator allows me to use other vim motions to select text and search for it.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nNow, to do something similar to other commands like :norm, I use:\n\nEx Commands and g command\nIf you have read the vim help docs, you may know some of these, but these are the little things that make a big difference.\n\nThe first option is for the : command. It allows you to use the tab completion to find the longest common match and then show the full list. The second option is for the wildignore option. It allows you to ignore certain files when using tab completion. The third option is for the suffixesadd option. It allows you to use gf to open files with the given suffixes. You can customize these to your liking, but adding this allows you to filter out the noise and focus on what you want to see.\nAdditionally, this is one of the must-have plugins:\n\nWilder is a fuzzy finder for Ex commands, search history, and command history. It is a must-have plugin for me because it allows me to search for commands and history in a more efficient way.\n\nUndo and Redo\nUndo and Redo are essential to any text editor. However, in Vim, you can make this more powerful! First,\n\nThe first option allows you to save your undo history. The next options add more power to undo as this updates undo when you use other vim operations. Now, we add:\n\n\nThis allows you to see your undo tree and navigate it with diffs – extremely useful when you want to see what you have done and what you can undo.\nCombine this with AutoSession, I can open a project and have all my windows, buffers, and undo history saved.\n\nMovement\nMovement is essential to any text editor. However, in Vim, you can make this more powerful! First,\n\nThis allows us to move line around in visual mode, move windows, and reside windows. Moreover, we can go up and down in long lines!\nFurthermore, I have some auto commands that allow me to move between windows and resize them:\n\nThis allows me to keep my windows equally resized and to remove the number column when I open a terminal.\nFinally, I have some plugins that help me with movement and manipulating text:\n\nThis allows me to repeat commands, add more targets like [], and auto complete pairs like (). Moreover, with nvim-surround, I can surround text objects with different characters like quotes, brackets, and braces. Finally with vim-matchup, I can see the matching pair of brackets, braces, and quotes. If the code is very long it also shows the top matching pair in a popup window.\n\nBetter quickfix\nIf are not taking advantage of the quickfix list, you are missing out. The quickfix list is a powerful tool that allows you to navigate through errors, warnings, and search results – anything as long as you know how to use it. However, I like to use a plugin to make it more powerful.\n\nThis allows me to navigate through the quickfix list with ease. In fact, this is the setup I used to showoff grepper.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nI integrated the quickfix list with other tools I’ll get to later.\nSpell Check\nVim has a built-in spell checker, but of course, we need to make it better.\n\nThis allows me to toggle spell check and fix spelling mistakes with &lt;leader&gt;z while not moving my cursor! In addition to this I use a language server (LSP) to check my spelling through language tool: ltex.\nStatus Line\nAt one point in your vim carer, you would have downloaded a status line plugin. After a while, though, you realize that you don’t need a status line plugin. You can make your own status line! Here is mine (with cache implmented):\n\nThis is my status line. It shows the current mode, language, branch name, file path, git status, word count, line number, column number, file size, and file type. It is a lot, but I hope my documentation helps you understand what each part does. It is extremely minimum but provides me with all the information I require depending on my current state.\n\n\n\nFormatting\nFormatting is essential to any text editor:\n\nHowever, I use a plugin to make it more powerful:\n\nThis allows me to format my code with neoformat and remove trailing whitespace with FixWhitespace. Moreover, I can still use the class = and gq to format my code. Very useful!\nBetter netrw\nI know, I know, netrw is not the best file explorer, but I don’t use it enough to care that much. However, I do have some settings to make it more bearable:\n\nThese settings remove the banner, open the file explorer in a vertical split, use the tree style, and set the size of the file explorer. Moreover, I can open files in the browser with gx.\n\nGit Integration\nNow, I made a video about this (here), so I won’t go into too much detail. However, I will show you how I set it up:\n\nHonestly, although this pretty simple, it is extremely powerful. I can see the git status, add files, diff files, edit files, write files, and see commits. Together with gh the github cli, I can do everything I need to do with git (though I do have more, which I will talk about in a later section)!\nFinally, I set Neovim to be my merge tool and diff tool (through ~/gitconfig):\n\nI then use diffget and diffput to merge my files with git mergetool\n\n\nWith this, we have completed all the fundamentals!\nGetting the full power out of Neovim\nIn the last section, I spent a lot of time buffing vim features. However, Neovim has been progressing and has added many new features that I have been taking advantage of. In this section, I will show you how I use these features to make my workflow more efficient.\nTreesitter\nTreesitter is a parser library that is used in real-time editing contexts, where it aims to fill the gap to manipulate and understand your code through the Abstract syntax tree (AST). Take, for instance, syntax highlighting. Originally, syntax highlighting was achieved through regular expressions that would match the tokens of the language you used. However, for large files that was a large tax. Now imagine if instead of matching the literal text to then syntax highlight, your text editor matches the nodes in the AST (and context) to highlight your code. Because treesitter operates within context, it is much more accurate to read your code and provides “better” syntax highlighting. For instance, what is the difference between a macro and a function — should that be highlighted different to notate that it has different behavior? Treesitter says yes, and I agree.\nHowever, if this were the only benefit, I would just shrug off the tool. It’s a lot of development to support a feature like this. It turns out however that treesitter updates its tree while you are typing in real time, which provides additional benefits than just more stable syntax highlighting. Yet, what catches my eyes is the extensibility of treesitter. Here we have a tool that can manipulate the AST – what can you with that? Well, you decide, but here are some of my uses: better code folding, swap function parameters, refactoring entire functions in a way a LSP can’t, and provide integration across multiple programming files.  Note the last one, which, I believe, is a feature that should impress you because if treesitter can work on a file with multiple languages, it can tell you what how comments work in that language, what indentation is ideal, what.a function block is in a language. That’s compelling, and what you can do with treesitter is up to you: you have full control of your text editor and AST.\nTreesitter is a tool for a programmer to do more with their code editor and I believe it brings more power to editing, reviewing, and writing code. Let’s take a look at how I write these blogs; I often have Rust, Markdown, and LaTeX:\n\nNotice, that treesitter can highlight the syntax of all three languages in the same file!\nHere is how I set up treesitter:\n\nThis setups treesitter, treesitter text objects, treesitter context, and treesitter commentstring. I also use neogen to generate doc comments for me. Additionally, I have the following settings:\n\nTogether, I am able to swap function parameters, select text objects, and move between text objects. More important, I can generate doc comments and use treesitter to provide context for my code.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nBetter terminal\nNeovim has :Term, but I prefer a terminal that persists, can open other TUI apps, and is customizable.\n\nCombined, this allows me to focus on one window and have a terminal that is always available:\n\nIn fact, I can combine this with LazyGit to have a terminal that can run lazygit and nvim at the same time. Let’s have a look:\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nThis allows me to work with git extremely efficiently. Here is the config I use:\n\nAnd here is the lazygit.toml file I use:\n\nThis all works through nvr, the neovim remote plugin, so make sure you have that installed.\n\nTelescope\nTelescope is one of those Neovim plugins that transform how you interact with virtually everything in your development environment—from files, code, documentation, to even running tasks and previewing media. Its extensible and customizable nature makes it a powerhouse for creating a truly personalized development environment. For instance, this is telescope in action with man pages:\n\nNow, let’s set up telescope:\n\nThis sets up telescope and telescope-frecency. Frequency is a plugin that allows you to search for files based on how frequently you use them. Here is how I map telescope:\n\nFinally, let’s get to the good parts. Customizing telescope:\n\nSince I have some large files, I have to check if the file is too large to preview. This is what the new_maker function dos and applies it to the previewer:\n\nTogether, I can move around my codebase with ease and preview files without slowing down my editor.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nNote: I wish I could set a default theme for telescope, but I can’t. I have to set it for each picker.\nCompletion\nJust a fair warning, I still use coc.nvim, but it works well for me!\nCopilot\nFirst, I use copilot to complete test cases and boilercode – I don’t trust it for logic, but it has its uses. Specifically, I use the lua version as I find it more configurable:\n\nThis allows me to use copilot to generate boilerplate code and test cases. Moreover, I can toggle the auto trigger with &lt;leader&gt;ck. This allows me to use copilot when I need it and not when I don’t.\nCoc.nvim\nI use coc.nvim for completion, but I have customized almost every single thing:\n\nThis sets up coc.nvim and vim-snippets. Here is how I set up coc.nvim:\n\nI know that nvim-lsp is the new hotness, but coc.nvim just has everything I need. I can use it to format my code, check diagnostics, and use snippets. Moreover, I can use it to check the documentation of a function or keyword. I can also use it to check the definition of a function or keyword. Finally, I can use it to check the references of a function or keyword. I can do all of this with a single plugin.\nMoreover, I am able to combine it with the quickfix list:\n\nFor instance, Coc makes it easy to use random LSPs like ltex, which I use for grammar checking in LaTeX:\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nFinally, here is my config:\n\nLatex\nFinally, as a Math major, I use LaTeX a lot. I use the following plugins to make my LaTeX experience better:\n\nTogether with sioyek, I can compile my LaTeX documents and view them in a pdf viewer automatically. Moreover, I can use latexindent to format my LaTeX documents.\n\n  \n  Your browser doesn't support the video tag, which I use in place of .gifs, and/or the video formats in use here –&nbsp;sorry!\n\nConclusions\nI know that was a lot, but I hope you learned something new. I have been using Neovim for a while now, and I have to say that it has been a game changer. I have been able to customize my text editor to fit my needs and make me more productive. I hope that you can do the same.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or comments. I would love to hear from you.\nSeniorMars\n","description":"A guy decides to show off his Neovim setup.","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/neovim-workflow/","path":"/posts/neovim-workflow/","title":"An Experienced (Neo)Vimmer's Workflow"},"https://seniormars.com/posts/new-website/":{"body":"So, I guess I have a blog now!

Yet, the more I read, the more I learned about the fallacies of\nmathematics. This piece is a critique of the mathematical proof, a reflection\non my own thoughts, and a way to introduce my concerns to the world as an\nintroduction piece. I hope you enjoy it: especially the poem at the end.\nProofs are at the heart of mathematics — a discipline that concerns itself with\nthe precise and rigorous development of ideas to find the “truth.”\nUnfortunately, while math strives for correctness through deduction, how we\nconstruct proofs contradicts the idea that math tries to be. Succinctly, the\nfallacy of proofs is illustrated through the difference in how proofs are\nconstructed in theory and practice. In theory, proofs are a series of logical\nstatements that follow from other logical claims — a definition posed by\nAristotle centuries ago — that seek to convince a reader of a claim or a truth\n1. In practice, however, proofs are written in natural language, often\nimprecise and ambiguous. The discrepancy between theory and practice is a\nfundamental problem in mathematics, especially when proofs are how\nmathematicians establish the validity of their claims and communicate their\nresults to others. Nevertheless, it has become clear to me that this problem\nhas been apparent to many throughout the history of mathematics. Several\nindividuals have tried to reason about logic and this problem through\nmathematical systems — fighting mathematics with mathematics. But the question\nremains: what happens now? How do we address the fallacy of proofs in\nmathematics?\nIntroduction towards Formal Verification\nIn principle, the academic world has prevented this fallacy through peer\nreview, a process that many have criticized 2 due to its various\nshortcomings. While peer review “adds a bit of certainty” 3 to mathematical\nwork, it is not an end–all solution to the problem of human error. A prominent\nexample of this flaw can be highlighted through a dynamical system theorem\npublished in 1970 by Noel Baker. Once published, the theorem was subsequently\nused to prove various results in dynamical systems; in turn, these results were\ngeneralized and furthered–establishing the influence of Baker’s theorem in the\nfield. However, half a century later, a pair of mathematicians discovered a\nflaw in Baker’s proof, a flaw so grave that it invalidated the\ntheorem — returning its status as an open problem 4. This example\nillustrates the potential for human error in mathematical proofs and the\nconsequences of such errors. Moreover, since the 20th century, this issue has\nbeen exacerbated by the increasing complexity of mathematical proofs.\nMathematics is now at a stage where it has become so complex that the field\nis beyond the comprehension of a single mathematician; a new proof is built\nupon the work of many mathematicians, each trusting the work of the other. A\nnew approach to the mathematical proof is needed; fortunately, a growing field\nseeks to address these problems at once: Formal Verification.\nFormal Verification emerges as a promising solution to the fallacy of\nmathematical proofs. It is a framework that extends the original purpose of\nproofs, focusing on verifying the correctness of a system or model through the\nuse of mathematical techniques. For our purposes, formal Verification treats\nproofs as mathematical objects and checks their correctness through a program,\noffering a metamathematical approach to mathematics. To fully grasp the\nimplications of Formal Verification, we delve into its historical development,\nthe often misunderstood relationship between computer science and mathematics,\nand the pivotal role of Type Theory in Formal Verification. We then introduce\nthe Lean Theorem Prover, a programming language that verifies the correctness\nof mathematical proofs. Finally, we talk about the Lean programming language to\nthe context of Partial Differential Equations, providing insights into the\nfuture of mathematics.\nPreliminaries\nThe notion of studying proofs as mathematical objects was popularized through\nthe concept of “Gödel Numbering” in the early 1930s. The technique provided a\nmethod to transform an object in any formal language, i.e., proofs in formal\nlogic, to a unique natural number through a bijective function 5. While the\nidea of formal methods can be attributed to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz — as\nLeibniz wished for a universal, correct, and logical language 6 — Gödel’s\nincompleteness theorems were the true beginning of the field. These theorems\nexplored the limitations of formal systems with notions of “numbers”; as many\nbranches of mathematics relied on ZFC-Set Theory, Gödel’s impact was profound.\nIn short (and imprecisely), Gödel’s theorems showed that any formal system\npowerful enough to express arithmetic was either inconsistent or incomplete.\nThese results could be interpreted as the first major hurdle to mathematical\nformalization, a problem that has yet to be fully resolved. In fact, David\nHilbert, a prominent figure in many fields, sought to formalize all mathematics\nthrough his project, the Foundations of Mathematics, which failed as Gödel’s\nwork showed that Hilbert’s approach was doomed to fail. Gödel’s work was so\ninfluential that it led to the creation of the field of Proof Theory, the study\nof proofs7. Ultimately, the first major hurdle to mathematics only\nemphasized the need for a new approach to proofs.\nWhere Computer Science and Mathematics Meet\nFor the longest time, a common misconception persists that formal verification\nhas only been a staple in computer science — that its application to pure\nmathematics is a recent development. Although, the reason for this\nmisconception is largely unknown to philosophers — this view, however,\noverlooks the intricate relationship between computer science and mathematics,\nas well as the historical trajectory of formal verification itself.\nFormal verification emerged as a distinct field within computer science in the\n1970s, with the primary objective of verifying software correctness 8. This\npursuit was driven by the recognition that software bugs could lead to\ncatastrophic consequences. A stark illustration of this potential for disaster\nis the Therac-25 incident, where a radiation therapy machine malfunctioned due\nto software errors, resulting in severe radiation overdoses to patients 9.\nSuch incidents underscored the critical need for rigorous verification methods\nin software development. The importance of formal verification in computer\nscience is further exemplified by NASA’s stringent requirements. The space\nagency mandates that compilers used in mission-critical software development be\nformally verified, although this requirement does not extend to the executable\ncode itself as it should be 10. This practice highlights the recognition of\nformal verification as a crucial tool for ensuring the reliability and safety\nof complex systems. Clearly, the techniques of Formal Verification have been a\ncornerstone of computer science for decades. However, to fully grasp the\nsignificance of its application to mathematics, we must explore the\nintricate relationship between programs and proofs — addressing the\nmisconception that the two are distinct entities. We begin by introducing the\nbasics of Constructive Mathematics, Type Theory, and the Curry-Howard\ncorrespondence, which form the foundation of Formal Verification.\nConstructive Mathematics\nConstructive mathematics, a branch of mathematical philosophy, challenges the\ntraditional notions of existence and proof in mathematics. In classical\nmathematics, a statement is considered true if its negation leads to a\ncontradiction, a principle known as the law of excluded middle. Constructive\nmathematics, however, rejects this principle 11. Instead, it requires that\nto prove the existence of a mathematical object, one must explicitly construct\nthe object. Similarly, to prove that a statement is true, one must provide a\nconstructive method for verifying the statement.\nThe constructive approach to mathematics was popularized by L.E.J. Brouwer in\nthe early 20th century as a critique of classical mathematics, particularly its\nreliance on non-constructive methods 11. In constructive mathematics, proofs\nare not merely theoretical arguments but are tied to the idea of computation. A\nproof of existence must come with a method to find or approximate the object in\nquestion, and this method must be executable in a finite number of steps. To\nillustrate this concept rigorously, consider the following proofs of the\nIntermediate Value Theorem:\nTheorem: Let $f: [a, b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such\nthat $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs (i.e., $ f(a) \\cdot f(b) &lt; 0 $).\nThen, there exists a point $ c \\in [a, b] $ such that $ f(c) = 0 $.\nIn classical mathematics, the Intermediate Value Theorem is typically proven by\ncontradiction: we assume that there is no such point $ c $ and then derive a\ncontradiction from the continuity of $ f $ and the assumption that $ f(a)\n$ and $ f(b) $ have opposite signs. However, this proof is non-constructive\nbecause it does not provide a method to actually find the point $ c $.\nConstructive Proof: We first define the interval $ I_0 = [a, b] $\nand let $ f(a) &lt; 0 $ and $ f(b) &gt; 0 $. The algorithm proceeds by\nrecursively bisecting the interval. At each step $ n $, we let $ I_n =\n[a_n, b_n] $ be the current interval, and $ m_n = \\frac{a_n + b_n}{2} $ be\nthe midpoint of the interval. We evaluate the function at the midpoint $\nf(m_n) $ and consider three cases: if $ f(m_n) = 0 $, then $ m_n $ is the\nroot; if $ f(m_n) &gt; 0 $, we set $ b_{n+1} = m_n $ and $ a_{n+1} = a_n $;\nif $ f(m_n) &lt; 0 $, we set $ a_{n+1} = m_n $ and $ b_{n+1} = b_n $. By\nrecursively bisecting the interval, we generate a sequence of nested intervals\n$ I_0 \\supset I_1 \\supset I_2 \\supset \\ldots $ that contain the root $ c\n$. Since $ f $ is continuous, the length of the intervals $ |b_n - a_n| $\ndecreases to zero as $ n $ increases. By the construction of the algorithm,\nthe sequence $ (m_n) $ converges to a limit point $ c $, and by\ncontinuity, $ f(c) = 0 $.\nThis constructive proof demonstrates the existence of $ c $, and provides a\nmethod to approximate $ c $ to any desired degree of accuracy by carrying\nout the bisection algorithm to a sufficient number of steps. Particularly, we\nmake no assumptions about the law of excluded middle, which is central to\nclassical mathematics but not required in constructive mathematics.\nType Theory\nType theory is a mathematical framework that serves as the foundation for many\nmodern formal systems; it has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th\ncentury. The origins of type theory can be traced to Bertrand Russell’s work\non the foundations of mathematics. In the early 1900s, Russell identified a\nparadox within the set theory of his time, known as Russell’s Paradox. To\nresolve this paradox, Russell proposed a system of types in which objects\ncould be classified into different levels or “types,” thereby preventing\nself-referential definitions that led to contradictions 12.\nAt its core, type theory is a formal system that classifies expressions into\nvarious types, ensuring that operations and functions are applied correctly.\nIn traditional logic, a proposition is either true or false. In type theory,\nhowever, a proposition corresponds to a type, and a proof of the proposition\nis an element of that type. Type theory has close ties to constructive\nmathematics — both emphasize construction. To illustrate the principles of\ntype theory, let’s consider a simple example: If $ A \\rightarrow B $ and $\nB \\rightarrow \\bot $ (the negation of $ B $) hold, then $ \\neg A $ must\nalso hold:\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$f : A \\rightarrow B$}\n\\AxiomC{$g : \\neg B = B \\rightarrow \\bot$}\n\\AxiomC{$x : A$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$f(x) : B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$g(f(x)) : \\bot$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$h : A \\rightarrow \\bot$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$h \\in \\neg A$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$f \\rightarrow g \\rightarrow \\neg A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\nLet’s break down the proof step by step to understand the logical reasoning\ninvolved:\n\nAssumption $ f : A \\rightarrow B $: We start by assuming that $ f $ is a\nfunction that takes an input of type $ A $ and produces an output of type $ B\n$. This corresponds to the premise that $ A \\rightarrow B $.\nAssumption $ g : \\neg B = B \\rightarrow \\bot $: Next, we assume $ g $, which\nstates that $ \\neg B $ is equivalent to $ B \\rightarrow \\bot $. In type theory,\n$ \\neg B $ (the negation of $ B $) is interpreted as a function from $ B $ to $\n\\bot $ (the type representing falsity or contradiction).\nAssumption $ x : A $: We introduce a new assumption $ x $ of type $ A $,\nwhich means we are assuming that $ A $ holds. This will help us derive a\ncontradiction later on.\nDeriving $ f(x) : B $: Applying the function $ f $ to $ x $, we obtain $ f(x)\n$, which has type $ B $. This means that under the assumption $ x : A $, we can\nconclude $ B $ by applying $ f $.\nDeriving $ g(f(x)) : \\bot $: Next, we apply $ g $ to $ f(x) $, which gives us\n$ g(f(x)) : \\bot $. This step uses the assumption $ g $ to derive a\ncontradiction $ \\bot $ from the fact that $ f(x) $ is of type $ B $. The\nfunction $ g $ essentially tells us that if $ B $ holds, then a contradiction\noccurs.\nDeriving $ h : A \\rightarrow \\bot $: From the contradiction $ g(f(x)) : \\bot\n$, we can construct a function $ h : A \\rightarrow \\bot $. This function $ h $\ntakes an assumption of type $ A $ and derives a contradiction. In other words,\n$ h $ is a proof that $ A $ implies falsity, which is the definition of $ \\neg\nA $ (the negation of $ A $).\nDeriving $ h \\in \\neg A $: The function $ h $ is now seen as an inhabitant of\nthe type $ \\neg A $. This means that we have shown $ \\neg A $ (the negation of\n$ A $) under the assumptions $ f : A \\rightarrow B $ and $ g : \\neg B $.\nConclusion $ f \\rightarrow g \\rightarrow \\neg A $: Finally, the last step\nconcludes the proof by showing that $ f $ (which implies $ A \\rightarrow B $)\nand $ g $ (which is equivalent to $ \\neg B $) together imply $ \\neg A $. This\nshows that if $ A $ implies $ B $ and $ B $ leads to a contradiction, then $ A\n$ must be false.\n\nAs a remark: Type theory often uses tree-style proofs, which are visual\nrepresentations of logical reasoning. Each node in the tree represents a\nlogical statement or type, and the branches show how conclusions are derived\nfrom assumptions through logical rules or function applications. To read a\ntree-style proof, start at the leaves (the assumptions) and follow the\nbranches to the root (the conclusion). This method clearly shows the logical\nsteps and dependencies, helping to ensure that each part of the proof is\nvalid. Tree-style proofs effectively demonstrate how propositions are proven\nin type theory by constructing terms that inhabit types.\nComputer Science and Mathematics\nThe convergence of computer science and mathematics finds one of its most\nprofound expressions in the concept of lambda calculus. Introduced by Alonzo\nChurch in the 1930s, lambda calculus provides a formal system for expressing\ncomputation based on function abstraction and application 13. Initially\nconceived as a foundation for mathematics, lambda calculus became a\ncornerstone of theoretical computer science, influencing the development of\nprogramming languages and computational models. Its ability to represent all\ncomputable functions made it a powerful tool for studying the nature of\ncomputation itself. Building upon this foundation, Church later developed the\nsimply typed lambda calculus, which introduced the concept of types to lambda\ncalculus 14. This extension addressed some of the paradoxes present in the\nuntyped lambda calculus and provided a framework for ensuring certain\nproperties of functions. In the typed lambda calculus, every term is assigned\na type, and only well-typed terms are considered meaningful.\nHowever, one of the most remarkable corollaries arising from this\nintersection is the Curry-Howard correspondence. The isomorphism,\nindependently discovered by Haskell Curry and William Howard, establishes a\ndeep correspondence between mathematical proofs and computer programs 15.\nThis isomorphism reveals that the relationship between a proposition and its\nproof in constructive logic is analogous to the relationship between a type\nspecification and a program in typed lambda calculus. The correspondence can\nbe illustrated through the following table:\nConstructive LogicTyped Lambda Calculus\nPropositionType\nProof of a PropositionTerm (Program)\nImplicationFunction Type\nConjunction (A &amp; B)Product Type (A x B)\nDisjunction (A or B)Sum Type (A + B)\nNegation (not A)Function Type (A -&gt; False)\nFalsehood (False)Empty Type\nUniversal Quantifier (forall x. P(x))Dependent Function Type\nExistential Quantifier (exists x. P(x))Dependent Pair Type\n\nThis table illustrates the fundamental correspondences between logical\nconstructs and their type-theoretic counterparts. Each row represents a pair\nof concepts that are isomorphic under the Curry-Howard correspondence,\ndemonstrating the deep connection between logic and computation that this\nisomorphism reveals.\nGiven this isomorphism, the decades of research in computer science devoted\nto understanding and optimizing programs can be directly applied to the study\nof proofs. In this light, proofs and programs are not just similar; they are\nfundamentally the same thing. This insight has profound implications for both\nfields. It allows us to leverage the vast body of knowledge in computer\nscience to study proofs in a new light and to approach programming with the\nrigor and formality traditionally reserved for mathematical proofs. This\nequivalence also paves the way for the use of type theory in Formal\nVerification.\nLean Theorem Prover\nThe Lean Theorem Prover, initially developed by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft\nResearch in 2013, is a formal proof verification system and a programming\nlanguage designed to facilitate the formalization of mathematical proofs 16.\nLean is grounded in the principles of Type Theory and leverages the\nCurry-Howard correspondence to treat proofs as executable programs. Unlike\ntraditional proof assistants, which may require significant effort to learn and\nuse, Lean’s design focuses on user-friendliness and accessibility, making it an\nincreasingly popular tool in both academic and industrial settings.\nAt its core, Lean provides a framework for the construction of proofs that are\nnot only rigorous but also verifiable by a computer. The language itself is\nbased on a variant of dependent type theory known as the Calculus of Inductive\nConstructions (CIC). CIC serves as the underlying formal system in Lean,\nproviding a powerful foundation for defining complex mathematical objects and\nreasoning about them. CIC integrates both inductive types and dependent types,\nallowing users to define functions and types that can depend on values, which\nis essential for formalizing a wide range of mathematical concepts. Moreover,\none of Lean’s most notable features is its emphasis on constructive\nmathematics. While it supports classical reasoning through the inclusion of the\nlaw of excluded middle as an axiom, Lean encourages users to provide\nconstructive proofs whenever possible. Constructive proofs are particularly\nvaluable in computational contexts, as they often correspond to algorithms that\ncan be directly implemented and executed.\nFinally, one of the key features of Lean is its extensive library, known as\n“mathlib.” This community-driven library contains a vast collection of\nformalized mathematics, including definitions, theorems, and proofs. Mathlib\nserves as both a resource and a foundation for further developments in formal\nverification, providing users with ready-to-use tools and examples. The success\nof mathlib is a testament to the collaborative nature of formal verification\nand the growing interest in Lean as a platform for mathematical exploration\n16.\nLean and Formal Verification\nLean’s formal verification process involves encoding a theorem as a type and\nthen constructing a proof of that theorem by providing a term of the\ncorresponding type. This approach is directly aligned with the Curry-Howard\ncorrespondence. By constructing a term that inhabits a type, one effectively\nconstructs a proof of the corresponding proposition. The advantages of using\nLean for formal verification are manifold. We list some of the key benefits\nbelow:\n\nHigh level of automation: Lean provides a high level of automation through\nits tactic framework, which allows users to build proofs incrementally,\nleveraging automation to handle routine or repetitive tasks. This feature makes\nthe process of formal verification more efficient and accessible, even for\ncomplex theorems 17.\nLean’s interactive proof mode enables users to develop proofs in a\nstep-by-step manner, with immediate feedback on the correctness of each step.\nThis interactive approach not only enhances the reliability of the verification\nprocess but also serves as an educational tool, helping users to understand the\nunderlying logic and structure of their proofs.\nLean’s role in formal verification extends beyond pure mathematics to\npractical applications in software verification. By formalizing the correctness\nof algorithms and software systems, Lean can help prevent errors that could\nhave significant real-world consequences, such as those seen in critical\nsystems like aerospace or medical devices. The capacity to rigorously verify\nsoftware properties before deployment underscores the importance of Lean in the\nbroader context of Formal Verification 18.\n\nIntroduction to Theorem Proving in Lean\nOne of the reasons Lean is so popular is due to it being a functional\nprogramming language based on dependent type theory. Moreover, one of its key\nfeatures is the use of tactics, which are commands that help construct proofs\nstep-by-step. Tactics allow users to guide the proof assistant in finding a\nformal proof, bridging the gap between human reasoning and machine-checkable\nformalism. Let’s consider a simple example to illustrate how proofs are\nconstructed in Lean using tactics. We’ll prove that for any propositions P and\nQ, if P implies Q and P is true, then Q is true. This is known as modus\nponens.\n\nLet’s break down this proof:\n\nThe theorem keyword declares that we’re proving a theorem\nnamed modus ponens.\n(P Q : Prop) declares P and Q as propositions.\n(h1 : P → Q) is the hypothesis that P implies Q.\n(h2 : P) is the hypothesis that P is true.\n: Q specifies that we want to prove Q.\nby begins the tactic mode, allowing us to use tactics to\nconstruct the proof.\napply h1 applies the implication P → Q to our goal. This\nchanges our goal from proving Q to proving P.\nexact h2 proves P using our hypothesis h2.\n\nThis example demonstrates two common tactics:\n\napply: This tactic applies a function or implication to the current goal.\nexact: This tactic proves the goal directly when we have a term of exactly\nthe right type.\n\nFor a more complex example, let’s look at a proof of function extensionality,\nwhich states that two functions are equal if they produce the same output for\nall inputs:\n\nThis proof uses more advanced concepts and tactics:\n\nshow: This tactic is used to restate the goal, often in a more specific\nform.\ncongrArg: This tactic applies the congruence rule for function arguments.\nQuotient.sound: This is a theorem about quotient types, used here to relate\nequality of functions to equality of their quotient representations.\n\nThese examples illustrate how Lean combines a powerful type system with an\nexpressive tactic language, allowing for the formalization of complex\nmathematical proofs in a way that is both rigorous and (with practice)\nintuitive to mathematicians.\nFormal Verification of Partial Differential Equations\nPartial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to many areas of\nmathematics and physics, modeling phenomena ranging from fluid dynamics to\nelectromagnetism. Given the complexity and sensitivity of PDEs, ensuring the\ncorrectness of their solutions is of utmost importance. This is where Formal\nVerification comes into play, offering a rigorous framework for verifying the\ncorrectness of mathematical proofs related to PDEs. One of the challenges in\nformally verifying PDEs is the need for a rich mathematical library that\nincludes concepts from real and functional analysis. The Lean mathematical\nlibrary, mathlib, has been developing these foundations, making it\nincreasingly feasible to work with PDEs in a formal setting.\nFormal Verification of Bump Functions\nBump functions play a crucial role in the study of PDEs, particularly in the\nconstruction of smooth partitions of unity and in the approximation of\ncontinuous functions by smooth functions. The formal verification of bump\nfunctions is therefore an important step towards the broader goal of verifying\nPDEs. Let’s examine how bump functions are formalized in Lean, first by\ndefining the structure of a bump function:\n\nThis structure defines a smooth bump function centered at a point $c$ in a\nnormed vector space $E$. The function is equal to 1 in the closed ball of\nradius rIn around $c$, and its support is contained in the open\nball of radius rOut. The properties of bump functions are then\nformalized:\n\nThese theorems establish key properties of bump functions:\n\nThe function is equal to 1 in the closed ball of radius rIn around $c$.\nThe support of the function is exactly the open ball of radius rOut around\nThe function is infinitely differentiable (smooth).\n\nThe formal verification of these properties ensures that the bump functions\nbehave as expected, which is crucial for their application in PDE theory. For\ninstance, in the method of characteristics for first-order PDEs, bump\nfunctions can be used to construct local solutions that can be patched\ntogether to form global solutions. Furthermore, the formalization includes\nproofs of differentiability properties:\n\nThis theorem proves that the composition of a bump function with a\ndifferentiable function is differentiable, which is essential for many\napplications in PDE theory, such as the construction of smooth approximations\nto solutions. The formal verification of bump functions lays the groundwork\nfor more advanced topics in PDE theory. For example, one could proceed to\nformalize:\n\nSmooth partitions of unity, which are crucial in the study of manifolds and in proving existence of solutions to PDEs.\nApproximation theorems, such as the density of smooth functions in various function spaces.\nRegularization techniques for PDEs, where bump functions are used to smooth out discontinuities or singularities in solutions.\n\nBy formalizing these fundamental tools, we pave the way for the verification\nof more complex results in PDE theory, ultimately leading to increased\nconfidence in the mathematical models used across various scientific\ndisciplines.\nDiscussion\nWhile the formalization of bump functions in Lean represents a significant\nachievement, it highlights the broader challenges associated with the formal\nverification of Partial Differential Equations. The current state of formalized\nmathematics in Lean, particularly within the realm of analysis, underscores\nseveral limitations that must be addressed before the formal verification of\nPDEs can be considered complete.\nFirstly, it is important to acknowledge that while bump functions are now\nformalized, PDEs as a whole remain largely uncharted territory in Lean. This is\nnot due to a lack of interest but rather the foundational nature of Lean\nitself. Derived from type theory, Lean has a strong focus on algebra, category\ntheory, and topology, with these areas being well-supported within the system.\nHowever, analysis, which is crucial for the study of PDEs, is notably\nunderdeveloped. For instance, the concept of partial derivatives, a fundamental\ntool in PDEs, is not standardized in Lean. This presents a significant obstacle\nfor those seeking to formalize results in this area. The root of this issue\nlies in the preferences of the mathlib community, which tends to prioritize\nabstract and general frameworks over the concrete tools typically used in\nanalysis. As a result, those working in the formalization of PDEs often find\nthemselves in need of basic constructs that are either unavailable or\ninsufficiently developed.\nMoreover, Lean’s learning curve is another factor to consider. While Lean is\nincredibly powerful, it requires users to spend a significant amount of time\nbecoming familiar with its syntax, tactics, and the underlying type theory.\nThis can be a barrier for mathematicians who are accustomed to more traditional\nmethods of proof construction and who may be unfamiliar with the more abstract\napproaches favored by Lean.\nAnother concern is the lack of formalized content in Lean related to\nundergraduate topics that are foundational for advanced studies in mathematics.\nFor instance, many fundamental concepts in multivariable calculus, differential\nequations, and Fourier analysis are either not implemented or only partially\ndeveloped in Lean. Key topics such as directional derivatives, Jacobian\nmatrices, Taylor’s theorem, and the Fourier transform are still missing or\nincomplete. This gap is problematic because it limits the applicability of Lean\nto a broad range of mathematical problems that are central to both theoretical\nand applied mathematics 19.\nThe absence of these topics in Lean presents a significant challenge for the\nbroader adoption of formal verification in mathematics. For mathematicians\nworking in areas where these tools are essential, the current state of Lean\nmay be seen as a deterrent, potentially limiting the impact of formal\nverification in these fields. Furthermore, without a comprehensive library\nthat covers these foundational topics, the adoption of formal verification in\neducational settings, particularly at the undergraduate level, remains\nlimited.\nDespite these challenges, the Lean community is growing rapidly, and the\ncontributions being made to mathlib are invaluable. The collaborative nature\nof the Lean project means that its capabilities are constantly expanding, and\nwith time, many of the current limitations may be addressed. The potential of\nLean to revolutionize mathematics is enormous. By providing a framework where\nproofs can be rigorously checked by a computer, Lean offers a level of\ncertainty that traditional methods cannot match. This is particularly\nimportant in an era where mathematical results are becoming increasingly\ncomplex and difficult to verify by hand.\nLooking ahead, it is not far-fetched to predict that in the coming decades,\nacademic journals may begin to require that proofs be verified by a formal\nsystem like Lean as a condition for publication. Such a shift would represent\na fundamental change in the way mathematical research is conducted,\nemphasizing the importance of formal verification in ensuring the correctness\nof mathematical results.\nWhile the formal verification of proofs using systems like Lean presents\nchallenges, particularly in areas such as analysis and PDEs, the benefits it\noffers are undeniable. As the community continues to grow and develop, the\ntools available in Lean will become more comprehensive, making it an\nincreasingly valuable resource for mathematicians. The critique of\ntraditional proofs highlighted at the beginning of this paper only\nunderscores the need for such tools. Formal verification represents the\nfuture of mathematics, offering a path toward greater rigor, reliability, and\nultimately, a deeper understanding of the mathematical universe.\nWhat’s Next?\nThroughout this blog, we traced the historical development of formal methods,\nexamined the theoretical foundations of constructive mathematics and type\ntheory, and investigated the practical implementation of these concepts in\nLean. The formalization of bump functions in Lean represents a significant\nmilestone in the journey towards the comprehensive formal verification of PDEs.\nThis demonstrates the potential of formal methods to enhance the rigor and\nreliability of mathematical proofs, even in complex areas of analysis. However,\nour exploration has also revealed substantial challenges that lie ahead.\nDespite these challenges, the rapid growth of the Lean community and the\ncontinuous expansion of mathlib offer reasons for optimism. The collaborative\nnature of formal verification projects suggests that many of the current\nlimitations may be addressed in the coming years. As the tools become more\ncomprehensive and accessible, we can anticipate a gradual shift in\nmathematical practice towards increased reliance on formal verification.\nLooking to the future, we can envision a mathematics landscape where formal\nverification plays a central role. The day may not be far off when major\nmathematical journals require formal verification of proofs as a condition for\npublication. Such a development would represent a paradigm shift in how\nmathematical knowledge is created, verified, and disseminated. The ongoing\ncritique of traditional proofs and the advancement of formal verification\ntechniques signal a transformative period in mathematics, one that promises to\nenhance both the precision and the understanding of this fundamental\ndiscipline. However, it is crucial to recognize that formal verification\nshould not be seen as a replacement for traditional mathematical thinking.\nRather, it should be viewed as a powerful complementary tool that enhances the\nreliability and clarity of mathematical results. The creative insights and\nintuitive leaps that characterize mathematical discovery will always be\nessential, with formal verification serving to solidify and validate these\ninsights.\nPoem\n\nIs math a joke or is it divine?\nThey say I’m bounded, set in my ways,\nfilling closed sets, stuck in displays.\nBut am I a function with no real root?\nOr a paradox dancing in Gödel’s suit?\nI know I’m unbounded, no number to measure,\nyet search for meaning in fractal design,\nwhere recursion leaves me stunned.\nTopology twists me; I can’t get a grip —\nam I a torus, or just full of lip?\nI sketch my vectors, orthogonal dreams,\nbut angles lie, or so it seems.\nA closed manifold — is that all I am?\nAm I defined by rules, by a close neighborhood?\nThey say to trust a basis, let matrices guide,\nbut eigenvalues only take me for a ride.\nI solve for x but she won’t solve me back,\nis it math or love that I really lack?\nI search for answers in math’s divide,\nPreventing cycles to abide and preside.\nIs truth a constant, or will it stray?\nCan I be a tangent and still find my way?\nIntuition is all I have, soft and sly,\nIt whispers a logic that can’t deny.\nMy proofs might slip, my steps may swerve,\nbut instinct calls — a gentle curve.\nThey say to trust structures, to keep it discrete,\nbut my heart’s uncountable, skipping each beat.\nLogic’s a guide, but instinct’s my art,\nmapping equations that start in the heart.\nSo I’ll let my thoughts take limits undefined,\nlet my intuition be more than defined.\nIf math’s just rules — then I’ll rewrite,\nmake space for both chaos and insight.\nBeyond theorems and symbols, I drift and roam,\nfinding claims in places far from home.\nAnd maybe that’s truth — a paradox neat,\nthat I can be flawed, and still complete.\n\n\n\n\nAristotle.

Once in the theater, and\nthe rest at home with the company of my nephew and niece. Now, let me tell you, I was originally\nlate to the party: the first time I saw it was in theaters in late January, but I immediately fell\nin love with the movie. It simply reminded me of the first time I saw Spider-verse: a thrilling ride\nwith a sweet story. Now, to me, Spider-verse is still the better film, however, it is\nundoubtedly in my top five animated films. Now with that preface out of the way, let me detail why I\ndecided to write this little blog.\nThe Last Wish was a great representation of people with mental disabilities. In fact, it tackled so\nmany hardcore emotions that I’m familiar with that I almost felt myself experiencing those same\nemotions in those critical moments that Puss had. Specifically, when Puss had a panic attack, I\nalmost cried. Partly due to the aforementioned emotions, but mostly because the way the film\ncaptured Puss’ anxiety had me remember all the times I’ve felt the same emotions. The short breath, your\nheart racing, and your vision tunneling. Honestly, I always had a hard time explaining what it’s like to\nhave a panic attack, but now I’m glad I have this film to show as reference—allowing people to\nunderstand the impact of these disabilities in everyday life. I’m so glad this film exists.\nNow, the other part I wanted to talk about was the difference of my level of hesitations I felt\ntowards “Big” Jack Horner and Perrito. Jack was a ranging psychopath. Perhaps to many he seemed like\nan empty villain, but in reality there are such individuals like him that exist. And just like Jack,\nthey believe they have the privilege to own anything they desire. Now, to some readers this\nobservation may be obvious, but nonetheless, it provides a perfect transition to talking about\nhesitation.\nSee, when I first saw Perrito, my guts screamed: “The Dog is a twist villain. DO NOT TRUST HIM.”\nNow, I’m sure many people felt the same as me. Perhaps it was due to the Disney influence having us\nbelieve that every animated film must have a twist-villain, OR, perhaps it was because we’re\nincredibly biased against people who act ‘nice’. With Jack Horner, we understand that there\nare psychopaths that have no sense of morality, which is why I believe our guts are fine with him\nbeing a “pure-blood-down-right-evil villain”, but with Perrito? It was almost the opposite. My\nmind refused to accept that such a good-hearted soul existed. I believe the reason for this is our\nprejudice, with us believing that nobody has “pure” motives. But just like there are psychopaths,\nI know that there are ‘pure-hearted souls’, the person who needs to change is me.\nOverall, I’m convinced that Puss and Boots is more or less a metaphor for mental issues. In that\nsense, it’s a good movie to fit adult-eccentric issues into a family friend movie. Truly a 9.5/10.\n","description":"A guy decides a movie is dedicated to him.","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/puss-thelastwish/","path":"/posts/puss-thelastwish/","title":"The Last Wish, Mental Health, and Hesitation"},"https://seniormars.com/posts/short-stories-one/":{"body":"Ergo: A collection of short stories\nA while back I said I would finish writing a book — I’m still working on it. In the meantime, here are some short stories I’ve written.\nPassengers\nThe subway car sat motionless, its hum reverberating through the stagnant air, mingling with the metallic tang of iron, the acrid bite of oil, and a faint, sour undertone that clung to the platform walls. Inside, I sat alone, the cold, unyielding plastic seat pressing into my back, grounding me in the stillness. The window beside me, scratched and smeared with grime, offered a distorted reflection of a figure just beyond the yellow safety line.\nHim. Me. The boy I used to be.\nHe shuffled his feet, his sneakers scuffing against the platform’s uneven concrete. His hoodie hung off him, loose and shapeless, the way I used to wear it—like armor that didn’t quite fit. His hands fidgeted inside the kangaroo pocket, fingers moving like he was trying to hold on to something that wasn’t there.\nHe didn’t meet my eyes. His gaze stayed locked on the empty tracks, as if the steel rails might whisper some elusive truth he couldn’t yet grasp. Overhead, the intercom sputtered to life, slicing through the oppressive quiet: “Ladies and gentlemen, we are delayed momentarily due to train traffic ahead of us.” The static lingered like a ghost, then faded.\nI leaned forward, elbows resting on my knees, my hands clasped tightly together. “Are you getting on?” I asked, my voice slicing through the silence.\nHe flinched, his shoulders stiffening, his head jerking slightly as though the question had startled him. “What’s the point?” he muttered, his voice low, almost swallowed by the distant sound of something clattering in the tunnel. “The train’s not moving.”\n“It will,” I said, my voice firm, though it felt like the weight of doubt pressed against my chest. “They always do, eventually.”\nHe didn’t respond, but his jaw clenched, his eyes betraying a flicker of something—hesitation? Fear? It wasn’t disbelief in me. It was disbelief in everything.\n“You could wait out there forever,” I said, leaning back against the hard plastic, “but you’d still be stuck.”\nHis head snapped up, his expression sharp and cutting. “Yeah? And what about you?” His voice cracked through the silence, raw and biting. “You’re sitting here, stuck on this train, acting like that’s any better. You call this moving forward?”\nThe words hit harder than they should have. Not because they were wrong, but because they weren’t.\n“I’m trying,” I said quietly, my voice catching in the air between us. The words felt too small, but they were all I had. “Isn’t that something?”\nHe stared at me, his face a mixture of defiance and something more fragile, something I recognized all too well: the sharp edges of hope dulled by the grind of disappointment.\nHe let out a bitter laugh, his head shaking as though my words had only solidified his doubts. “Trying,” he said, the word dripping with disdain. “That’s it? That’s what I have to look forward to? Sitting on a train that doesn’t even know where it’s going?” His hands moved inside his hoodie pocket, restless, searching for some kind of anchor. “You’re sitting there calling yourself a dreamer, like that makes it all okay. But what has dreaming ever done for you? You’re still here. Still nowhere.”\nThe word hung in the air: dreamer. It felt heavy, hollow, like a worn-out promise.\nI swallowed hard, my fingers curling around the edge of the seat. “Dreaming doesn’t mean standing still,” I said finally. “It’s about moving, even when you don’t know where the track ends. It’s about believing there’s something—anything—on the other side of the tunnel, even if you can’t see it yet.”\nHe turned his head, his eyes fixed on the streaks of graffiti along the platform wall. “And what if there’s nothing?” he asked, his voice quieter now, but no less sharp.\n“Then at least I’ll know I tried,” I said, my voice steady. “You’re afraid to fail. I get it. I’ve been there. But failure’s not the worst thing. The worst thing is standing outside, watching the train leave without you.”\nThe intercom crackled again. “Please stand clear of the closing doors. We will be departing soon.”\n“I’ve fallen more times than I can count,” I continued, leaning back, my voice soft but firm. “But every time, I got back up. Not because I had to, but because I wanted to. That’s what dreaming is—it’s wanting to get back up, no matter how many times you fall.”\nHe looked at me then, his eyes meeting mine for the first time. They were sharp, narrowed with defiance, but I saw the cracks beneath—softer, quieter things he didn’t know how to hide. His foot shifted closer to the edge of the platform. For a fleeting moment, I thought he might step forward, might take that final step onto the train.\nBut he stopped, his hesitation palpable. Relief flickered in me, unbidden and faint, but it was swallowed by something darker, something hotter—a feeling that burned in my chest and curled in my throat.\nAnger.\nHe was still standing there, hesitant, like stepping onto the train would mean conceding some unseen battle. As if this whole situation wasn’t already a loss. That hesitation, that fragile indecision, cracked something open in me—a heat I’d been swallowing for too long, waiting for the right words that never came.\n“You think I’m proud of this?” I snapped, the words spilling out sharper than I intended. “You think I wanted us to be here, stuck in this goddamn system, fighting for scraps, waiting for trains that don’t even come on time?”\nHis head jerked up, startled. For a moment, he looked small, fragile even. But the fire in my chest didn’t care.\n“I’m angry too,” I said, my voice rising. “I’m furious that we had to fight so hard just to stand in this place, on this platform, waiting for something we were told was already ours. I’m angry that I had to spend my entire life dreaming of a world where you wouldn’t have to feel this way—scared, stuck, uncertain.”\nHe stared at me, wide-eyed, his hands stilling in his pockets. The platform was silent except for the distant rumble of another train somewhere far away.\n“I’m mad because you don’t deserve this. I didn’t deserve this. And no matter how hard I’ve worked, how much I’ve dreamed, it feels like I’ve spent every moment since you existed just trying to make the world a little less cruel for you. But here we are.”\nHe didn’t say anything, but something shifted in his gaze. The sharpness softened, replaced by something quieter, something that made him seem older and younger all at once. His fingers curled and uncurled in slow, deliberate movements, like he was holding and releasing the weight of my words.\n“I’ve carried your fear, your hopes, your goddamn weight for years,” I said, quieter now but no less fierce. “I’ve fallen, I’ve failed, and I’ve bled to make something better for us. And you know what?” I leaned forward, my reflection in the window merging with his face. “It still might not be enough. That’s the hardest part. I might not ever be enough.”\nThe admission hung in the air, uncomfortably honest, but it didn’t feel as heavy as I thought it would. I leaned back, staring into the tunnel ahead, letting the stillness settle over me.\n“I’m not proud of this,” I said, the edge of my voice softening. “But I’m still here. I’m still standing. I’m still dreaming, even when I’m mad at the world for making us fight this hard just to be seen. I dream because it’s all I’ve got, and because you deserve better. So yeah, I’m angry. But I’m not done. Not for you, not for me.”\nHe didn’t move right away, but something in his posture shifted. His shoulders relaxed just slightly, the tension in his frame melting into something more hesitant, more open. His hands slipped out of his hoodie pocket, resting at his sides like he was finally ready to stop bracing himself.\n“Come on,” I said, even quieter now, my voice losing its edge. “Get on the train. It’s not about where it’s going. It’s about not staying here.”\nHe hesitated, staring down at the narrow gap between the platform and the train. His foot hovered for a moment, trembling like the whole world was balanced on the edge of that decision. Then he stepped forward. And then again. Slowly, almost reluctantly, he crossed the threshold and sat down across from me, his movements stiff and uncertain.\nFor a moment, neither of us spoke. The train jolted forward, its lights flickering as the platform slid into darkness behind us. He leaned back against the seat, his eyes fixed on the streaking tunnel walls outside. I noticed the way his lips quirked, just faintly—almost a smile.\nAnd for the first time in what felt like years, I smiled back.\nThe anger still sat with me, low and simmering. I doubted it would ever leave. How could it? It wasn’t just anger at the world or the circumstances that had shaped us—it was anger at myself. At how long I’d spent fighting, clawing, and falling, only to end up here, still searching for stability, still carrying his weight.\nBut as I looked at him—at the boy I used to be, the boy I still carried in so many ways—I realized something: that anger, that weight, it was what drove me. It was why I kept getting back up, even after every failure, every broken dream. I was still living for him, and maybe I always would be.\nAnd yet, for the first time, I didn’t resent it.\nBecause that drive, that weight—it wasn’t just his. It was mine. It was about learning to carry it, to move forward step by step, even when the tracks ahead were nothing but shadows and questions.\nThe train’s rhythm steadied, a quiet pulse beneath us. He looked up, his lips curving into the smallest of smiles—uncertain, but real.\n“You think we’ll make it?” he asked, his voice barely louder than the hum of the wheels.\nI held his gaze for a moment, then let out a breath I didn’t realize I was holding. “I don’t know,” I said, my own smile breaking through, soft but sure. “But maybe not knowing is part of it.”\nThe tunnel stretched ahead, its darkness yielding to the faint, flickering glow of the next station in the distance.\nAnd together, we moved forward.\nThe Reasonable Man\nThomas had always considered himself a rational person. Then he got cursed with extreme reasonableness.\nIt started innocently enough, during a perfectly normal Tuesday lunch break when Kurt Gödel materialized beside his sandwich. Not a flesh-and-blood Gödel, mind you, but a shimmering, mathematical apparition composed entirely of logical symbols and set theory notation.\n“Congratulations,” the spectral Gödel announced, adjusting his incorporeal glasses. “You’ve been chosen to bear the burden of ultimate reasonableness. Have fun with that.” Then he vanished, leaving behind only the faint scent of chalk dust and broken axioms.\nAt first, Thomas didn’t notice anything different. But then the affliction began to manifest.\nHe found himself unable to get angry at traffic jams because he kept considering the complex systems of urban planning and the reasonable limitations of infrastructure development. Road rage became road mild-understanding.\nDuring arguments, he’d stop mid-sentence to acknowledge valid points in his opponent’s reasoning. His girlfriend broke up with him after he spent three hours explaining why her frustration with his emotional unavailability was “logically sound given the predetermined axioms of romantic expectations in contemporary society.”\nThe real crisis came during a mathematics lecture when he raised his hand and asked, “But why base 10? Isn’t it arbitrary? Couldn’t we just as reasonably use base 12? Or base π? Is anything real?”\nGödel appeared again that night, floating above Thomas’s bed while he tried to sleep.\n“How’s the reasonable life treating you?” the apparition asked, smirking.\n“Well,” Thomas began, sitting up, “it’s both optimal and suboptimal, depending on one’s chosen metric for evaluation. Though of course, the very concept of metrics is inherently subjective, built upon arbitrary foundations of measurement that we’ve collectively agreed upon through social contract, which itself is a construct based on…”\n“Yes, yes,” Gödel interrupted, “you’re getting it. Keep going.”\nThe next week was a descent into deeper realizations. Thomas spent three hours in the grocery store, paralyzed by the reasonable arguments for and against each breakfast cereal. He wrote a 47-page proof explaining why his preference for chocolate over vanilla was simultaneously valid and invalid based on different sets of axioms.\nHis coworkers found him in the break room, surrounded by coffee cups, muttering about how the concept of a “coffee break” was a social construct built on arbitrary divisions of time, and really, wasn’t time itself just another axiom we’d chosen to believe in?\nGödel’s appearances became more frequent. He’d show up in mirrors, in puddles, once as a particularly mathematical-looking cloud.\n“Having fun yet?” he’d ask, while Thomas hyperventilated over the inherent incompleteness of his tax returns.\nThe breaking point came during a dinner date (with someone who hadn’t yet heard about the cereal incident). Thomas spent two hours explaining why the restaurant’s rating system was based on subjective value judgments that couldn’t be proven consistent within their own system.\n“But that’s perfectly reasonable,” he insisted to his fleeing date’s back. “Just like how the Axiom of Choice is both consistent and independent of ZFC! Wait, come back! I can prove it using a well-ordered set of relationship definitions!”\nThat night, Gödel found Thomas sitting in his kitchen, surrounded by textbooks, empty coffee cups, and scattered notes covered in increasingly desperate attempts to prove that anything at all was objectively true.\n“Ready to understand the joke?” Gödel asked, perching on a stack of philosophy books.\n“There is no objective truth, is there?” Thomas whispered. “It’s all just different sets of assumptions leading to different kinds of reasonable conclusions. Even this conversation could be reasonably interpreted multiple ways depending on our chosen axioms of reality.”\n“Now you’re getting it!” Gödel beamed. “Isn’t it wonderful?”\nThomas started laughing. Then crying. Then both at once, which was perfectly reasonable given the circumstances.\n“So what do I do now?” he asked, wiping his eyes. “How do I live in a world where everything is simultaneously reasonable and unreasonable?”\nGödel shrugged, his form flickering like a faulty mathematical projection. “Same way everyone else does. Pick your axioms, live with the inconsistencies, and try not to think too hard about why we use base 10.”\n“That’s… that’s not very reasonable,” Thomas protested.\n“Exactly!” Gödel exclaimed. “Now you’re really getting it!”\nAnd with that, he vanished, leaving Thomas alone with his reasonable confusion, which was, all things considered, the only reasonable response to an unreasonable universe.\nThomas still has his extreme reasonableness, but he’s learning to live with it. These days, he only spends an average of 45 minutes choosing breakfast cereal, and he’s almost convinced himself that it’s okay to prefer chocolate for no logically rigorous reason.\nSometimes, late at night, he swears he can hear Gödel laughing. But then again, that’s just one reasonable interpretation of many possible sound wave phenomena, isn’t it?\nOpposite Ends of the Spectrum\nIf there’s a spectrum of happiness, I’m pretty sure I’m on one extreme: the wide-eyed, goofy, relentlessly optimistic quokka. The kind of creature that smiles at every shadow, assuming it’s a friend. And her? She’s the viscacha—calm, serious, with that perpetual frown that seems to carry the weight of ancient wisdom. She doesn’t believe in frivolous smiles or fleeting joys; she believes in caution, in stillness, in thinking twice.\nWe met in a world that wasn’t quite hers or mine. Somewhere between my sunlit, carefree fields and her rocky, contemplative cliffs. She looked at me like I was a joke. I looked at her like she was a puzzle I wanted to solve.\n“You can’t just… smile all the time,” she said one day, watching me scurry around, making the most out of nothing. “It’s exhausting just to look at you.”\n“And you can’t just frown forever,” I replied, hopping closer. “How do you even enjoy the world if you keep your head down so much?”\nFor a while, we were stuck in our corners of the spectrum. She would sit in the shade, arms crossed, watching as I tried to turn every moment into an adventure. I would try to pull her out of her stillness, only to be met with her exasperated sighs. It felt impossible—how could we ever compromise when we were made so differently?\nBut slowly, we began to meet in the middle.\nShe taught me the beauty of quiet moments. How not every second has to be filled with action, that some joys are found in stillness. We’d sit together on her favorite rock, overlooking a world that seemed a little less chaotic when we were side by side.\nAnd I taught her to loosen up. That it’s okay to chase sunbeams and let your guard down every now and then. She even smiled once—a small, fleeting thing, but I swear it lit up the cliffs.\nWe didn’t change completely. I still smile at shadows, and she still sighs at my antics. But somewhere along the way, we found a rhythm that worked. Her grounded nature anchored my energy, and my optimism softened her edges.\nWe weren’t the same. We didn’t need to be. We were the quokka and the viscacha—opposite ends of the happiness spectrum, somehow meeting in the middle.\nAnd it worked. It really worked.\nUnfinished Sketches\nThe kitchen table trembles as I write, each equation bleeding through the thin paper onto the wood beneath. It’s 3 AM, and the house breathes with the quiet rhythm of my sleeping family. The margin of my daughter’s math homework has become my blackboard – careful not to obscure her own neat calculations, I’ve filled every empty space with fragments of quantum mechanics, trying to understand how light bends and time flows.\nMy son’s cough echoes from down the hall. I pause, pen hovering over half-finished derivations, listening for the pattern I’ve memorized: three sharp coughs means his asthma is flaring, four means I need to ready the nebulizer. Two coughs, then silence. He settles back to sleep, and I return to my stolen education.\nThe kitchen walls are a patchwork of my obsessions. Between the calendar of doctor’s appointments and school events, I’ve pinned diagrams of flying machines sketched on the backs of past-due notices. Next to the grocery list hangs a study of muscle mechanics, drawn while waiting at the pharmacy for my wife’s medication. The refrigerator holds my daughter’s artwork alongside my attempts to decode the mathematics of beauty – the golden ratio found in her crooked smile, the fractal patterns in the way her hair curls.\nDuring my lunch breaks at the warehouse, I read. Today it’s a worn copy of da Vinci’s notebooks, rescued from the library’s discard pile. My coworkers joke about it – call me “Professor” as they pass by. They don’t understand why anyone would choose to spend their precious thirty minutes studying the flight patterns of birds or the flow of blood through the heart. But in those pages, I see myself – or rather, who I could have been. A universal mind. A Renaissance soul trapped in the machinery of necessity.\nAt night, after the dishes are done and homework is checked, I sometimes allow myself to dream. I imagine my name in academic journals, my designs changing the world, my understanding of the universe expanding beyond these cramped kitchen walls. The possibilities unfold like infinite reflections in parallel mirrors – each one perfect, pristine, and permanently out of reach.\n“Daddy?”\nMy daughter stands in the doorway, blanket clutched to her chest. The clock reads 3:47 AM.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Just some work, sweetheart.” I close the notebook, sliding it under bills I need to sort tomorrow. “Bad dream?”\nShe nods, and I open my arms. She climbs into my lap, small and warm and real, while Leonardo’s sketches peek out from beneath the overdue electric bill. Her breathing slows as I hold her, and I feel the weight of her trust – heavier than any textbook, more complex than any equation.\nThe next morning, I receive an email from the online physics course I’ve been taking. My latest paper on theoretical quantum mechanics has caught the professor’s attention. He wants to discuss my ideas, mentions words like “potential” and “extraordinary insight.” He suggests I consider applying to their graduate program.\nI read the email three times during my break, then delete it.\nThat night, my wife falls asleep on the couch waiting for me to finish my “studies.” I cover her with a blanket, noting how the shadows under her eyes have deepened since she took the second job. On the coffee table, her nursing school application sits half-completed. She’s put it off three years now, always saying my dreams should come first because “you’re the genius in the family.”\nI stand in our dark living room, surrounded by the ghosts of unfinished ideas. They hover in the shadows – perpetual motion machines, revolutionary algorithms, philosophical treatises. Each one a road not taken, a universe unexplored. My mind races with possibilities, with the burning certainty that I could solve these puzzles if only I had time, if only I had resources, if only, if only…\nMy son’s inhaler needs to be refilled next week. My daughter’s school shoes are wearing thin. The car makes a sound that means expensive repairs are coming. Each necessity is a door closing, each responsibility a weight anchoring me to earth while my mind strains toward the stars.\nI gather my notebooks – physics, engineering, philosophy, art – and stack them neatly in a box. My hands shake as I close the lid, but my heart is steady. The truth is, I’ve always known this choice was coming. The world is full of undiscovered brilliance, potential locked away by circumstance. History only remembers the geniuses who had the luxury of time, the freedom to pursue their obsessions to their natural conclusions.\nI am not Leonardo. I will never be Einstein. My theorems will remain unproven, my inventions unbuilt, my understanding of the universe fragmentary and incomplete. But my children will be fed. My wife will finally apply to nursing school. Our home will be warm in winter.\nThat night, I dream of flying machines and unified theories. But when I wake, I make breakfast, pack lunches, kiss foreheads, and drive to the warehouse. My mind still soars with questions about light and time and the architecture of reality. But my love is anchored here, in the solid world of small needs and vital necessities.\nSometimes, on my lunch breaks, I still read. But now I keep my notes in my head, let my dreams live in the spaces between breaths. The universe whispers its secrets, and I listen, even though I can no longer answer back. Perhaps that’s enough – to know that I could have soared, but chose instead to build a nest, to shelter the dreams of those who depend on me.\nAfter all, some forms of genius lie in the choices we make, in knowing when to fold our paper wings and walk the solid earth. There’s a different kind of renaissance in learning to live with the weight of unrealized potential, in finding grace in the gap between what we could become and what we choose to be.\nTonight, I will help my daughter with her math homework. And if she asks me about the stars, I will tell her everything I know, and then I will tell her to fly higher than I ever could.\nNotes from a Thursday Night\nI sit here, cross-legged on unwashed sheets,\nsurrounded by textbooks I pretend to read.\nAnother night of almost-understanding,\nof reaching for thoughts that slip like smoke\nthrough fingers too clumsy to catch them.\nThey say college is where minds catch fire.\nMine just smolders, giving off toxic fumes\nthat smell like yesterday’s coffee\nand tomorrow’s disappointment.\n(God, I’m so tired of disappointing.)\nMy roommate’s out again, living what they call\n“the best years of our lives” while I\nconjugate verbs in languages I’ll never speak,\nmemorize formulas I’ll never use,\nchase dreams I’ll never catch.\nThe library closes in twenty minutes.\nI should go – pretend I belong among\nthe bright ones, the quick ones,\nthose who understand on first reading,\nwho raise their hands without their hearts racing.\nInstead, I stare at my reflection\nin a laptop screen gone dark,\ncounting the hours until dawn,\nadding them to the collection\nof nights I’ve wasted being almost-good.\nMy father calls these growing pains.\n(He means well, they all mean well.)\nBut what grows in these fluorescent hours\nbesides the stack of half-filled notebooks\nand the weight of what I cannot grasp?\nSometimes I think I feel it coming –\nthat moment when it all makes sense,\nwhen the fog lifts and reveals\nthe person I’m supposed to be.\nBut it’s just another false dawn.\nThe group chat buzzes with plans:\nFriday nights and future dreams.\nI type “maybe next time” with practiced ease,\nthen return to these pages\nthat refuse to yield their secrets.\nMy high school valedictorian speech\nsits in a drawer somewhere, yellowing,\nfull of promises about potential\nand the future’s bright horizon.\n(God, we were all so young.)\nNow I’m here, three years deep\nin a game I don’t know how to win,\nwatching others soar past\nwhile I remain earthbound,\nheavy with the weight of mediocrity.\nBut still I sit, and still I try,\nand still I fill these margins\nwith desperate annotations,\nas if understanding might come\nthrough sheer stubborn repetition.\nTomorrow I’ll smile in class,\nnod at all the right moments,\npretend I’m keeping pace.\nTonight, I’ll sit with my failure,\nlet it teach me what it will.\nMaybe that’s all I’ll ever be:\nThe one who tried too hard\nto be what others are by nature.\nThe one who loved the dream\nenough to bear the waking.\nSo here’s to another night\nof almost-understanding,\nof reaching for thoughts that slip away,\nof being less than I should be,\nbut more than I was yesterday.\nThe library’s closed now.\nMy coffee’s gone cold.\nThe words still swim before my eyes,\nbut I remain here, drowning slowly,\nin the beauty of the trying.\n","description":"A guy writes random short stories","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/short-stories-one/","path":"/posts/short-stories-one/","title":"Ergo: A collection of short stories"},"https://seniormars.com/posts/spiderman-across/":{"body":"After watching Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (ATSV) for the fifth time in theaters today, I finally\nrealized why I adore this movie. In fact, this simple realization made me understand why I wasn’t so\nbig on the Tom Holland or Andrew Garfield films: New York City and the spirit the city brings to the\nhero. Batman has Gotham City, Superman has Metropolis, and Spider-Man has New York—the Big Apple.\nTalk to any New Yorker, and you will get a consensus: Spider-Man is one of our most significant\nsymbols. And, it goes without saying: Spider-man is a New Yorker. Simple as that. Thus, a simple\nextension to this idea is that if you want to get Spider-Man right, you must capture New York right,\nor it won’t work. Imagine Spider-Man swinging in a rural town — it’s silly. It just can’t work;\nunless you intend to power down a hero. Now, with all this said and done, I want to highlight why\nsome Spider-Man films are so beloved among die-hard fans and why some failed to impact the public\nthrough an analysis of New York’s Music, Culture, and People in these films.\nEver since I gained consciousness, I only remembered one place: New York City. My sweet, dirty, and\nmagnificent home. While I’m personally from the best borough–Brooklyn, I take pride in all of New\nYork City and my fellow New Yorkers. This is why, I believe, I’m qualified to talk shit and praise\nthe city when it is needed and why I notice when there is something fundamentally odd about\nestablishing the city in an adaption. With that as a preface, let’s get started!\n“Stand clear of the closing doors please.”, When I first heard this phrase in Spider-Man: Into the\nSpider-Verse (ITSV), as Miles was trying to escape the Prowler, I knew the film’s creators truly\nunderstood how to make New York City culture shine. After a beaming introduction to Miles’s neighborhood\nfilled with teenagers playing basketball, walking, and trying to get to school, you are placed at\nthe heart of Brooklyn with all its busyness and liveliness. You are set in a film that\nhappens to focus on our protagonist, Miles, but with how packed the block is, you understand the New\nYork is a city where events occur 24/7. These shots characterize and make the viewer understand\nwhy any Spider-man would have difficulty with time management — it’s part of the culture of New\nYork to always hustling. So, when you see and hear the train make that little announcement after\nnearly crushing Miles, it only furthers the viewer’s understanding that the city never stops and\nthe environment that makes shapes Spider-Man’s ability to always get up.\nNow, moving on to a different movie, Spider-Man 2 (Raimi), we see similar characteristics displayed\nas we journey through Peter’s everyday life. Immediately after Peter tries to jump off a building,\nfails, and lands on a car injuring his back, we get a slow shot of Peter walking away with no one\npaying attention. While the scene was definitely included for comedic effect, it illustrates a\nunique characteristic of New York: everyone is doing their thing. It significantly contributes to\nwhy many people consider New Yorkers cold, distant, or unfriendly if they are from somewhere other\nthan the city. Yet, from the perspective of a New Yorker, this is our way of showing kindness: we\nare aware that everyone has their problems, which is why we give them space unless they ask for our\nhelp. Despite all of this, the famous train scene cements my opinion that Spider-Man 2 did New York\nright. Immediately after Peter stops the train from falling off the bridge, we are shown an\nincredible scene where New Yorkers, on their own, form a shield to protect Spider-man from Doc Ock.\nAs previously stated, New Yorkers try to leave other New Yorkers alone. Still, when the time comes,\nyou find us protesting and roaming the streets to bring awareness to societal problems. Being\nreleased a few months after 9/11, this scene highlighted and condensed another significant quirk of\nNew York: we protect our own even if we aren’t strong enough. The action taken by the people on the\ntrain supplements that the love between Spider-man and New York goes both ways and that Spider-man\nis at his best when interacting with his people: New Yorkers.\nEven more, Spider-Man Into, Across, and the Raimi trilogy further this claim by combining music and\nstriking visuals. Hip-hop is a genre crucial to New York’s nightlife. With songs like “The Empire\nState Of Mind” by Alicia Keys and Jay-Z or “Big Poppa” by Notorious B.I.G., New York has a\nreputation for being a center of music and creativity. By hiring specifically Black and Latino\nartists to create both Spider-verse’s soundtracks, we receive songs that describe the culture of the\npeople in New York. For instance, “Familia” by Nicki Minaj, Anuel AA, and Bantu merges Spanish and\nEnglish to represent the hundreds of Spanish immigrants that grow with both languages. Combined with\nvisuals that include both New Yorkers and Spider-man, viewers are allowed to experience the mass\ndiversity that New York has without it being forced down their throats. Furthermore, the Raimi\ntrilogy instead opts to show the creativity of New York by having an underground Asian violinist\nsing and perform songs about Spider-Man. Reflecting a common experience in New York, where Musicians\ntry to prompt their selves by performing live in train stations or busy New York streets. Both\nexamples demonstrate how these films lean onto New York experiences to enhance Spider-Man’s\nreputation as a friendly and local superhero – creating a realistic world that hosts the\nweb-slinger that you can imagine living instead of a pure fantasy world with no ties to the real New\nYork.\nAs a juxtaposition, we can see why most die-hard Spider-Man fans were not pleased by Tom Holland or\nAndrew Garfield’s editions of our webbed hero as their versions aren’t engrained in New York\nculture. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, in specific, lacks the charm of a local Spider-man in most of his\ntrilogy. With one film completely taking place away from New York. Spider-Man is a tragic hero who\nunderstands he can use his powers to help others. At the core of his character is a funny individual\nwho uses his abilities to fight various supervillains and, more importantly, helps the people in his\ncommunity. Garfield and Holland’s Spider-Man only really did the former as both heavily needed more\ninteractions with nonimportant characters, i.e., their local new yorkers. Spider-Man is supposed to\nbe relatable, but how can viewers relate to a character if his environment is highly unrealistic? In\na way, these films were cinematic superhero movies but not actual Spider-Man films.\nSpider-Man shines when he interacts with his community. Any superhero can have fantastic action\nscenes that place them in dangerous situations, but not every superhero can be relatable. Spider-Man\nis supposed to be relatable. Anyone can be Spider-Man with the drive and connection to their\nenvironment. If you get the setting right, you enhance Spider-Man. If you get it wrong or a lack his\nfriendliness, then he is just a superhero, but he isn’t a true Spider-Man. Spider-Man Across the\nSpider-Verse gets it right, which is why I love it. Simple as that.\n\nAnother thing, I want to talk about is how much I relate to Miles and his Mom LOL. I got a full\nscholarship to a good school, and my mom tried to convince me to rejected it cuz it was too far. She\nwanted me to go a community college a few miles from my house. See, this is what I mean Spider-Man\nneeds to be relatable.\n","description":"A guy decides to gatekeep Spider-man / NYC.","id":"https://seniormars.com/posts/spiderman-across/","path":"/posts/spiderman-across/","title":"Don't forget about New York!

Ask a computer scientist about computation, and you’ll hear of algorithms and Turing machines. Pose the same question to a logician, and watch them expound on formal proofs and axioms. A category theorist, meanwhile, might wave their hands toward morphisms and elaborate commutative diagrams.\nThroughout much of the 20th century, these three perspectives seemed to speak entirely different languages, each isolated in its own intellectual silo. Then something remarkable happened. Starting in the late 1900s, a profound realization began to crystallize: programming languages, formal logic, and category theory aren’t separate disciplines at all! Rather, they represent different manifestations of a single underlying structure—interconnected as intimately as electricity, magnetism, and light in Maxwell’s revolutionary equations.\nThis insight, sometimes called the Computational Trilogy, builds on a deceptively simple but profound idea:\n\nProofs are programs.\nPrograms are morphisms.\nTypes are propositions.\n\nCould anything be more elegant? Formalized as the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence, this unification suggests that logic, computation, and mathematical structure aren’t just similar—they’re different expressions of the same fundamental reality. Each domain offers a unique lens for viewing the others; together, they create what John Baez aptly called a “Rosetta Stone” for modern mathematics.\nBut why should we care?\nFar beyond its elegant theoretical beauty, this framework has begun transforming everything from how we design programming languages to how we approach automated theorem proving, even reshaping the very foundations of mathematics itself. Where might this lead? Consider the emergence of homotopy type theory, the rising popularity of dependently typed programming languages, and the surprising yet seemingly inevitable convergence of classical and quantum computation—all pointing toward an ever-deeper unification.\nYet for all its power, the correspondence remains incomplete. How do the intuitive, sometimes messy proofs of human mathematicians fit into this framework? Can we extend it to embrace discrete mathematics, where combinatorial structures often resist elegant formulation? What happens when we venture beyond classical computation into quantum mechanical realms, where the rules of logic themselves appear to shift and transform?\nThrough this blog, I hope to explore precisely these questions. My goal isn’t just to explain theoretical curiosities but to demonstrate why this unification of logic, programming, and mathematics holds such transformative potential—not just for specialists, but for anyone fascinated by computation, proof, and mathematical truth. Most importantly, it is to make this link: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computational+trilogy more accessible to a wider audience. Note: all images are from the same link.\nThe Problem With Borders\nOur tendency to separate disciplines is a deeply ingrained habit of thought. Mathematicians have long viewed proofs as distinct from computation, even as the rise of proof assistants like Lean and Coq suggests that writing proofs and writing programs are becoming indistinguishable. Likewise, computer scientists often see programming languages as a domain of syntax and algorithms, without recognizing that their very structure is dictated by deep logical principles.\nCategory theory, for its part, often seems like an esoteric abstraction, despite the fact that it offers the most general possible language for describing computation. The reluctance to embrace these connections is understandable. Each discipline has its own historical development, its own motivations, its own culture.\nBut as we will see, once you adopt the computational trilogy as a guiding principle, the artificial boundaries between these fields dissolve.\n\nNo longer is a proof just a sequence of logical deductions—it becomes an algorithm actively computing its conclusion.\nA function in programming transcends its role as mere instructions—revealing itself as a morphism in a mathematical category.\nAnd a logical proposition? Far more than a statement about truth—it emerges as a type describing computational possibilities.\n\nThis perspective doesn’t just unify fields—it expands our tools for understanding mathematics itself.\nA Roadmap\nIn this blog, we will explore:\n\nOrigins of the Trilogy\nThe Curry-Howard correspondence: proofs as programs.\nLambek’s categorical extension: programs as morphisms.\nHarper’s vision of computational trinitarianism.\nThe Rosetta Stone of Computation\nConcrete examples of the correspondence.\nBeyond the Trilogy: New Frontiers\n\nHomotopy type theory: when types behave like spaces.\nThe rise of quantum computation: from classical logic to linear logic.\nWhat comes after proof? Mathematical intuition, unformalized reasoning, and the limits of formalism.\n\n\n\nThis is a story about unification—but also about boundaries, and where they begin to break down. It is about how computation, once thought to be just a tool, is becoming the very fabric of mathematics itself. All of this while trying to be as accessible as possible, without sacrificing depth.\nOrigins of the Trilogy\nThe discovery that proofs, programs, and mathematical structures are deeply interwoven did not happen all at once. It unfolded in stages, through a series of insights spanning logic, computation, and category theory. What we now call the Computational Trilogy emerged from a confluence of three major developments:\n\nThe Curry-Howard Correspondence – the realization that proofs are programs.\nLambek’s Categorical Perspective – the generalization that programs are morphisms.\nHarper’s Computational Trinitarianism – the philosophical framework that unites logic, computation, and category theory into a single, interconnected vision.\n\nEach of these developments transformed its respective field, but together, they form a single, powerful idea: mathematics and computation are not separate; they are two sides of the same coin.\nThe Curry-Howard Correspondence: Proofs as Programs\nMathematics is the study of absolute truths, yet for centuries, mathematicians have been unknowingly writing computer programs without ever compiling them.\nA proof is often thought of as a static object, a sequence of logical deductions frozen on the page. But what if we view proofs differently—not as static arguments, but as dynamic computations? This is the heart of the Curry-Howard Correspondence, a discovery that revealed a profound connection between logic and computation.\nThis insight wasn’t just a clever academic observation—it fundamentally transformed both fields by establishing that:\n\nMathematical proofs and programs share the same underlying structure\nPropositions in logic correspond directly to types in programming\nProving a theorem is isomorphic to constructing a program of a given type\n\nWhen I first encountered this correspondence in high school, it felt like discovering that two languages I had been studying separately were actually dialects of the same underlying structure. It was a moment of profound clarity—suddenly, the boundary between proving theorems and writing code disappeared.\nThe story begins in the early 20th century when formal logic underwent a foundational shift. David Hilbert sought to formalize all of mathematics, but this ambition was shattered by Gödel’s incompleteness theorems. Gödel’s work hinted at an intricate relationship between proofs and computation, which was soon made explicit by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing with their independent formalizations of computability.\nBut it wasn’t until the work of Haskell Curry and William Howard that the full isomorphism emerged. Their insight laid the groundwork for Per Martin-Löf’s intuitionistic type theory, bridging proof theory and computation. This work eventually led to modern proof assistants like Coq, Lean, and Agda, which allow mathematicians to write proofs that can be checked by a computer—effectively “compiling” mathematics for the first time.\nThe Isomorphism: Beyond Simple Correspondence\nThe Curry-Howard Correspondence tells us that the act of proving a theorem is structurally identical to writing a well-typed functional program. This isn’t a vague metaphor; it is a direct translation between propositional logic, type theory, and programming languages.\nLogic (Intuitionistic)Type TheoryProgramming\nProposition $A$Type $A$Data type declaration\nProof of $A$Term $t : A$Program of type $A$\nAssumption $A$Variable $x : A$Function parameter\nImplication $A \\rightarrow B$Function type $A \\to B$Function declaration\nConjunction $A \\land B$Product type $A \\times B$Tuple/record type (e.g., (A, B) in Haskell)\nDisjunction $A \\lor B$Sum type $A + B$Tagged union/variant (e.g., Either A B in Haskell)\nUniversal quantification $\\forall x. P(x)$Dependent product $\\Pi x:A. B(x)$Generic/polymorphic function\nExistential quantification $\\exists x. P(x)$Dependent sum $\\Sigma x:A. B(x)$Existential type/data hiding\nFalsity $\\bot$Empty type $\\emptyset$Void type (uninhabited)\nTruth $\\top$Unit type $()$Unit type (singleton)\nNegation $\\neg A$Function $A \\to \\bot$Function to Void\n\nThis means that checking a proof for correctness is the same as type-checking a program. Running a program corresponds to simplifying a proof. If a proof contains an inconsistency, it is equivalent to a type error in a program.\nInference Rules as Type Rules: Proofs Construct Programs\nThe correspondence extends beyond static structures to inference rules themselves. Every logical deduction rule has a corresponding type rule in lambda calculus.\nExample 1: Implication Introduction (Function Definition)\nIn logic:\n\nIn typed lambda calculus:\n\nInterpretation: Assuming $A$ allows us to derive $B$, which corresponds to defining a function that takes an argument of type $A$ and produces a result of type $B$.\nExample 2: Modus Ponens (Function Application)\nIn logic:\n\nIn typed lambda calculus:\n\nInterpretation: Applying a function of type $A \\to B$ to a value of type $A$ produces a result of type $B$, just as modus ponens allows us to infer $B$ from $A \\to B$ and $A$.\nComputation as Proof Normalization: Code as Proof Execution\nOne of the most striking aspects of the Curry-Howard Correspondence is how program execution relates to proof simplification (also known as normalization).\nConsider this logical proof with an unnecessary detour:\n\nThis corresponds to the Haskell program:\n\nWhen evaluated, it reduces to a. Similarly, in proof theory, we normalize this proof to a simpler one:\n\nThus, evaluating a program is equivalent to simplifying a proof.\nA Concrete Example: Function Composition as Logical Transitivity\nLet’s prove the transitivity of implication:\n$$\n(A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow C) \\rightarrow (A \\rightarrow C)\n$$\nLogical proof in natural deduction:\n\nCorresponding Haskell program:\n\nOr in lambda calculus:\n$$\n\\lambda f. \\lambda g. \\lambda x. g(f(x))\n$$\nThe computational content of this proof is function composition.\nReal-World Applications: From Proof Assistants to Functional Programming\nThe Curry-Howard Correspondence has profoundly shaped both mathematics and computer science:\n\n\nProof Assistants &amp; Dependently Typed Languages\n\nCoq, Agda, and Lean allow us to write proofs as programs.\nExample: Proving composition in Coq:\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Language Design\n\nFunctional languages like Haskell, Idris, and Scala directly implement Curry-Howard ideas.\nRust’s borrow checker enforces affine logic (a variant of linear logic).\n\n\n\nEffect Systems &amp; Modal Logic\n\nMonads in Haskell correspond to modal logic.\nContinuations implement classical logic.\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters: Computation as Mathematics\nWhen we write well-typed code, we are constructing mathematical proofs. A type error is a logical inconsistency. A program transformation is a proof transformation.\nThis perspective reshapes how we think about programming:\n\nProving a theorem is just writing a program.\nEvaluating a program is just simplifying a proof.\nRefactoring code is transforming one proof into another equivalent one.\n\nAs Philip Wadler beautifully put it:\n\n“Proofs are programs, and programs are proofs.”\n\nThe Curry-Howard Correspondence gives us our first glimpse into the computational trilogy, but it’s only the beginning. To complete the picture, we need to explore how these programs—these proofs—relate to the mathematical structures of category theory. This brings us to Lambek’s remarkable insight that programs are morphisms in a category.\nLambek’s Categorical Perspective: Programs as Morphisms\nWhile the Curry-Howard Correspondence established a connection between logic and programming, Joachim Lambek extended this perspective into category theory. His work in the 1970s provided an even more abstract viewpoint: programs are morphisms in a category.\nThis insight generalizes the Curry-Howard Correspondence. Not only are proofs equivalent to programs, but programs themselves can be understood as morphisms—structured transformations between objects in a mathematical framework.\nTo fully grasp this shift, we must first define what a category is.\nDefinition: Category\nA category $\\mathcal{C}$ consists of:\n\nA collection of objects (e.g., types in a programming language, propositions in logic).\nA collection of morphisms (arrows) between these objects, representing transformations.\nTwo fundamental properties governing these morphisms:\n\nComposition: If $f : A \\to B$ and $g : B \\to C$, then there exists a composite morphism $g \\circ f : A \\to C$.\nIdentity: Each object $A$ has an identity morphism $\\text{id}_A : A \\to A$, which behaves neutrally under composition.\n\n\n\nFormally, this means:\n\n\nAssociativity: For all morphisms $f : A \\to B$, $g : B \\to C$, and $h : C \\to D$,\n$$\nh \\circ (g \\circ f) = (h \\circ g) \\circ f.\n$$\n\n\nIdentity laws: For every morphism $f : A \\to B$,\n$$\n\\text{id}_B \\circ f = f = f \\circ \\text{id}_A.\n$$\n\n\nThese rules ensure that morphisms behave like structured transformations, forming a robust framework for reasoning about functions, types, and proofs.\nTyped Lambda Calculus as a Category\nLambek’s key insight was that typed lambda calculus naturally forms a category. In this categorical perspective:\n\nTypes correspond to objects in a category.\nPrograms (functions) correspond to morphisms between these types.\nFunction composition corresponds to morphism composition.\n\nFor example, in typed lambda calculus:\n\nA function of type $A \\to B$ can be interpreted as a morphism $f : A \\to B$.\nIf we have another function $g : B \\to C$, we can compose them to obtain a new function $g \\circ f : A \\to C$, just as in category theory.\n\nThis correspondence can be visualized as:\n$$\nA \\xrightarrow{f} B \\xrightarrow{g} C\n$$\nwhich combines into:\n$$\nA \\xrightarrow{g \\circ f} C.\n$$\nThe Syntax-Semantics Connection\nWhat makes this correspondence profound is that it connects syntax (terms in lambda calculus) with semantics (morphisms in a category). The equivalence classes of lambda terms constitute the morphisms in the induced category.\nMore precisely, given a typed lambda calculus L, we construct a category C(L) where:\n\nObjects are the types of L\nArrows $A \\to B$ are equivalence classes of terms of type B with exactly one free variable of type A\nArrow equality is defined by beta-eta equivalence: $(x:A, M(x)) = (x’:A, N(x’))$ if and only if $M(x) =_{\\beta\\eta} N(x)$\nIdentity arrow $id_A: A \\to A$ is the pair $(x:A, x)$\nComposition of $(x:A, M(x)): A \\to B$ and $(y:B, N(y)): B \\to C$ is $(x:A, N[M(x)/y]): A \\to C$, where $N[M(x)/y]$ means substituting $M(x)$ for $y$ in $N(y)$\n\nThis construction satisfies the category axioms:\n\nAssociativity: $(h \\circ g) \\circ f = h \\circ (g \\circ f)$ follows from the associativity of substitution\nIdentity: $id_B \\circ f = f = f \\circ id_A$ follows from the definition of substitution\n\nCorrespondence Between Typed Lambda Calculus and Category Theory\nTyped Lambda CalculusCategory Theory\nTypeObject in a category\nFunction $A \\to B$Morphism $f : A \\to B$\nLambda abstraction $\\lambda x:A.M$Currying operation $\\Lambda$\nFunction application $M(N)$Evaluation morphism $eval$\nIdentity function $\\lambda x. x$Identity morphism $\\text{id}_A$\nFunction composition $g \\circ f$Morphism composition $g \\circ f$\n\nThis perspective expands the Curry-Howard Correspondence: not only are proofs equivalent to programs, but programs themselves can be understood as structured transformations within a category.\nCartesian Closed Categories (CCCs) and the Structure of Computation\nA natural question arises: what kind of category best models typed functional programming? The answer is Cartesian Closed Categories (CCCs).\nA Cartesian Closed Category (CCC) is a category $\\mathcal{C}$ that satisfies three conditions:\n\n\nTerminal Object: There exists an object $1$ such that for every object $A$, there is a unique morphism $!_A: A \\to 1$.\n\n\nProducts: Every pair of objects $A, B$ has a product $A \\times B$ with projection morphisms:\n$$\n\\pi_1 : A \\times B \\to A, \\quad \\pi_2 : A \\times B \\to B.\n$$\nMoreover, for any morphisms $f: C \\to A$ and $g: C \\to B$, there exists a unique morphism $\\langle f, g \\rangle: C \\to A \\times B$ such that $\\pi_1 \\circ \\langle f, g \\rangle = f$ and $\\pi_2 \\circ \\langle f, g \\rangle = g$.\n\n\nExponential Objects: For every pair of objects $A, B$, there exists an exponential object $B^A$ and an evaluation morphism:\n$$\neval_{A,B} : B^A \\times A \\to B\n$$\nsuch that for any morphism $f : C \\times A \\to B$, there exists a unique morphism $\\Lambda(f) : C \\to B^A$ making the following diagram commute:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\nC \\times A &amp; \\xrightarrow{f} &amp; B \\\\\n\\lVert\\\\\nC \\times A &amp; \\xrightarrow{\\Lambda(f) \\times id_A} &amp; B^A \\times A &amp; \\xrightarrow{eval_{A,B}} &amp; B\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n\nThese structures correspond precisely to the computational constructs in typed lambda calculus:\n\nThe terminal object $1$ corresponds to the unit type.\nProducts $A \\times B$ correspond to pair types.\nExponentials $B^A$ correspond to function types $A \\to B$.\nThe evaluation morphism corresponds to function application.\nThe currying operation $\\Lambda$ corresponds to lambda abstraction.\n\nThe equations governing CCCs correspond exactly to the reductions in lambda calculus, including beta and eta reduction.\nNow that we’ve established the connections between logic and programming (Curry-Howard) and between programming and category theory (Lambek), we can finally see how all three perspectives unite into a single, coherent vision of computation—what Robert Harper calls “Computational Trinitarianism.”\nHarper’s Vision of Computational Trinitarianism: A Unified Perspective on Computation\nWhile Curry-Howard shows us that proofs are programs and Lambek shows that programs are morphisms, Harper’s insight is that these aren’t just correspondences—they are three facets of a single phenomenon. His concept of Computational Trinitarianism is an attempt to express the deep unity between logic, programming languages, and category theory—not as mere correspondences, but as three manifestations of a single mathematical truth.\nHarper’s vision is perhaps best summarized as:\n\nLogic, Programming, and Category Theory are not just similar—they are the same.\nEach provides an essential perspective on the nature of computation.\n\nThis view is doctrinal, almost theological in its emphasis on three-in-one unity. In fact, Harper explicitly borrows the language of religious doctrine to frame this insight:\n\nThe central dogma of computational trinitarianism holds that Logic,\nLanguages, and Categories are but three manifestations of one divine notion\nof computation. There is no preferred route to enlightenment: each aspect\nprovides insights that comprise the experience of computation in our lives.\n— Robert Harper, 2011\n\n\nThe idea is not just that these fields are connected—but that any computational concept should be meaningful in all three aspects. If you discover something fundamental in one, it must have a counterpart in the other two.\nWhat makes this perspective so powerful is how it transforms our approach to computational concepts. Rather than viewing a new idea through a single lens, we can triangulate its meaning across all three domains simultaneously. If you discover something fundamental in one realm, its counterparts in the other two realms must exist and offer complementary insights.\nI remember when this unified perspective clicked for me—I was struggling to understand monads (as every functional programmer does at some point), when suddenly seeing the categorical, logical, and programming perspectives simultaneously made everything clear. The three views reinforced each other, like looking at a complex shape from multiple angles.\nThe Rosetta Stone of Computation: Three Views, One Truth\nIn his influential paper “Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone,” John Baez and Mike Stay explicitly drew the analogy to the ancient Rosetta Stone. Just as that archaeological artifact displayed the same text in three different languages—hieroglyphics, demotic script, and ancient Greek—allowing linguists to decode previously impenetrable language systems, the computational trilogy serves as our modern Rosetta Stone for decoding the languages of mathematics, logic, and computation.\nHarper’s computational trinitarianism is most clearly expressed in the following three-way correspondence between Logic, Programming, and Category Theory:\nLogic (Proofs)Programming (Types &amp; Terms)Category Theory (Morphisms)\nProposition $A$Type $A$Object $A$\nProof of $A$Program of type $A$Morphism $f: 1 \\to A$\nAssumption $A$Variable $x : A$Projection $p_A$\nImplication $A \\to B$Function type $A \\to B$Exponential object $B^A$\nConjunction $A \\land B$Product type $A \\times B$Cartesian product $A \\times B$\nDisjunction $A \\lor B$Sum type $A + B$Coproduct $A + B$\nFalsehood $\\bot$Empty type $0$Initial object $0$\nTruth $\\top$Unit type $()$Terminal object $1$\nModus Ponens $A, A \\to B \\vdash B$Function application $f(a)$Evaluation morphism $\\text{eval}$\nUniversal quantification $\\forall x. P(x)$Dependent function $\\Pi x:A. B(x)$Dependent product $\\Pi x:A. B(x)$\nExistential quantification $\\exists x. P(x)$Dependent pair $\\Sigma x:A. B(x)$Dependent sum $\\Sigma x:A. B(x)$\n\nThis correspondence is more than a metaphor—it’s an equivalence of structures. If you remove the surface-level differences in notation, all three fields are describing the same underlying phenomenon.\n\nBack to the Curry-Howard-Lambek Correspondence: When Three Worlds Collide\nThe deeper I’ve ventured into the computational trilogy, the more I’ve come to appreciate the sheer elegance of the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence. What began as separate intellectual traditions has crystallized into one of the most beautiful unifications in mathematical science.\nAgain, to emphasize this! The Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence shows us that:\n\nLogic (proofs)\nProgramming (typed lambda calculus)\nCategory Theory (cartesian closed categories)\n\nare three perspectives on the same underlying phenomenon. Consider two fundamental structures:\n\nThe category $\\mathbf{Set}$ of sets and functions\nA meet-semilattice $\\mathbf{P}$ with implications (a model of propositional logic)\n\nBoth of these turn out to be cartesian closed categories! This gives us a three-way correspondence table that reveals the underlying unity:\nCartesian Closed Category$\\mathbf{Set}$$\\mathbf{P}$ (Logic)Typed $\\lambda$-calculus\nObjects/1-cellsSetsPropositionsTypes\nMorphisms/2-cellsFunctionsEntailmentTerms/Programs\n1-cell compositionCartesian product $S \\times T$Conjunction $A \\wedge B$Product type\nIdentity 1-cellOne-element set ${*}$True proposition $\\top$Unit type $()$\nRight Kan extensionFunction set $T^S$Implication $A \\rightarrow B$Function type\nEvaluation morphismFunction applicationModus ponensTerm application\nCurrying$f: C\\times A\\rightarrow B$ to $\\Lambda f: C\\rightarrow B^A$Deduction theoremLambda abstraction\n\nI gasped when I first saw this table. It was literally everything I was studying!\nThe Dogma: No Concept Exists in Isolation\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of Computational Trinitarianism is how it serves as a research guiding principle. It suggests that:\n\nIf you discover a new logical system, it should have an interpretation in type theory and category theory.\nIf you propose a new type system, it should correspond to proof rules and categorical structures.\nIf you define a new categorical construction, it should express something in logic and computation.\n\nI’ve found this principle enormously helpful in my own work. When encountering a difficult concept in one domain, I often seek its “translations” in the other two. This triangulation helps clarify the essence of what I’m studying. This explains why linear logic led to linear types, why modal logic corresponds to monads, and why higher category theory is shaping homotopy type theory.\nSequent Calculus and Categorical Structure\nLogical reasoning in sequent calculus form:\n$$\\frac{{\\Gamma_i \\vdash \\Delta_i}_{i\\in I}}{\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta}$$\ndirectly corresponds to composition rules in a category. The entailment relation $A \\vdash B$ (read “B follows from A”) is precisely a morphism in our category!\nThis connection transformed how I think about type theory. When I write:\n\nI’m not just defining a function—I’m establishing a categorical composition rule that mirrors logical entailment. The type signature itself is a proposition, and the implementation is a proof!\nBeyond Classical Structures: The Higher Trinity\n\nThe Computational Trinity extends naturally into more advanced mathematical domains. Consider how it manifests in higher mathematics:\nType theory gets enriched to homotopy type theory, categories become higher categories, and the entire framework elevates to what we might call “higher computation.” This evolution allows us to model not just whether proofs exist, but the spaces of possible proofs and transformations between them.\nWhen I first read about Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, I was fascinated by how it connected homotopy theory, type theory, and higher categories. The idea that equality is path connection in a space, which corresponds to type equivalence in programming and isomorphism in category theory, reveals the trilateral nature of mathematical thought itself.\nMathematical Structures Through the Trinitarian Lens\nEven basic mathematical structures reveal this three-way perspective. Consider the concept of a group:\n\nA group can be viewed as:\n\nA set with operations satisfying axioms (set-theoretic view)\nA type with operations and proofs of properties (computational view)\nA one-object category with invertible morphisms (categorical view)\n\nThese aren’t just different definitions—they’re different manifestations of the same fundamental structure, each revealing aspects that might be obscured in the others.\nBeyond the Original Trilogy: The Parametrized Perspective\nJust when I thought I’d wrapped my head around the computational trinity, the rabbit hole went deeper. It turns out that our lovely trinity was just the beginning of an even more profound unification. The extension into what I call the “parametrized perspective” represents one of those mathematical moments that made me spill my coffee in excitement.\nWhat happens when we consider that computation doesn’t happen in a vacuum? What if we acknowledge that:\n\nComputation happens in contexts and is proof relevant\nCategories give rise to systems of slice categories (and are in general $(\\infty,1)$-categories)\nTypes may depend on other types and are in general homotopy types\n\nThis realization transforms our well-established computational trinity into something richer and more nuanced.\nThe Enhanced Trinity: A Four-Way Correspondence\nThe traditional computational trilogy enhances to a four-way correspondence:\nIn dependent homotopy type theoryIn programming languagesIn locally cartesian closed $(\\infty,1)$-categoriesIn non-abelian cohomology\nA term of some type in contextA program of some data type in contextA generalized element of an object in a sliceA cocycle in twisted cohomology\n\nLet’s unpack this correspondence with the technical rigor it deserves.\nContexts and Slice Categories\nIn dependent type theory, a context $\\Gamma$ represents assumptions or variables in scope. When we write a judgment like:\n$\\Gamma \\vdash t : A$\nWe’re saying that term $t$ has type $A$ under assumptions $\\Gamma$.\nCategorically, this corresponds to working in a slice category. Given a category $\\mathcal{C}$ and an object $X$, the slice category $\\mathcal{C}/X$ has:\n\nObjects: morphisms $f: Y \\to X$ in $\\mathcal{C}$\nMorphisms: commutative triangles\n\nThe slice category $\\mathcal{C}/X$ precisely captures the idea of “computation in context $X$.” This is not just a formal analogy—it’s a deep mathematical equivalence. When I first understood this, it completely changed how I view type checking!\nFrom Categories to Higher Categories\nThe connection deepens when we consider that ordinary categories are insufficient for capturing the richness of type theory. We need $(\\infty,1)$-categories, which track:\n\nObjects (types)\n1-morphisms (functions)\n2-morphisms (homotopies between functions)\n3-morphisms (homotopies between homotopies)\n…and so on\n\nAn $(\\infty,1)$-category has $n$-morphisms for all $n \\geq 1$, and all $k$-morphisms for $k &gt; 1$ are invertible. This structure perfectly captures the notion of proof relevance in type theory.\nIn a proof-relevant system, we care not just about whether a proposition is true, but about how it’s proven. The space of all possible proofs forms a higher-dimensional structure, and different proofs can be related by homotopies (paths between proofs). This is precisely what $(\\infty,1)$-categories model!\nThe Algebraic Topology Connection\nThe deepest layer of this correspondence connects to algebraic topology through the work of Schreiber, Lurie, and others. This connection reveals that the very structure of computational type theory maps onto cohomology theories.\nThe equivalence with algebraic topology opens up a profound connection: a generalized element in an $(\\infty,1)$-topos may equivalently be regarded as a cocycle in (non-abelian) cohomology, and in twisted cohomology if in a slice $(\\infty,1)$-category.\nFor example, in twisted cohomology, the cup product of a 0-cochain $f$ with values in $\\text{Hom}(E, F)$ and a 1-cochain $g$ with values in $E$ gives a 1-cochain with values in $F$. This is exactly analogous to function application in dependent type theory!\nPractical Implications: Where Theory Meets Practice\nThis expanded correspondence isn’t just mathematical abstraction—it provides a unified framework for solving real problems:\n\n\nProgram Verification Through Topology\nWhen we view programs through the lens of non-abelian cohomology, topological invariants become tools for proving program properties. The fundamental group can detect unreachable states in a program’s execution space.\n\n\nHomotopy Theory Computation\nThe type-theoretic perspective allows us to compute topological invariants constructively. For instance, computing the homotopy groups of spheres becomes a matter of constructing specific terms in type theory.\n\n\nEffect Systems as Cohomological Twistings\nComputational effects in programming languages (exceptions, state, IO) can be understood as “twistings” in cohomology. A monadic effect system corresponds to a twisted cohomology theory where the twisting cocycle represents the effect.\n\n\nHere are the updated sections with the suggested improvements:\nThe Univalence Axiom: A Concrete Example\nPerhaps the most striking example of this parametrized perspective in action is Voevodsky’s univalence axiom, which states:\n$(A \\simeq B) \\simeq (A =_{\\mathcal{U}} B)$\nThis means that equivalence of types is equivalent to equality of types in the universe type $\\mathcal{U}$. In programming terms, it says that isomorphic data structures are interchangeable. In categorical terms, it says that equivalent objects in a category should be considered equal. In cohomological terms, it says that cohomologous cocycles represent equivalent structures.\nThe univalence axiom is implemented in systems like Cubical Agda, allowing programmers to transport programs along type equivalences, turning type-level isomorphisms into computational paths.\nThe Quantum Trilogy: A Parallel Correspondence\nWhile exploring the depths of the computational trilogy, I stumbled upon a parallel framework that completely shifted my understanding. This alternative correspondence—what I’ve dubbed the “quantum trilogy”—connects linear logic, quantum computation, and monoidal categories in a way that’s mathematically elegant and conceptually profound.\nWhat makes this correspondence so striking is how it mirrors yet transforms the classical trilogy. Where the classical world embraces copying and deletion of information, this quantum realm enforces strict resource management.\nFrom Classical to Quantum: Three Parallel Transitions\n\nFrom intuitionistic logic to linear logic\nFrom classical computation to quantum computation\nFrom cartesian closed categories to closed monoidal categories\n\nEach of these transitions represents moving from a world where information can be freely copied and deleted to one where resources must be precisely accounted for.\n\nIn the classical world, information can be freely copied and discarded.\nIn the quantum world, information must be precisely accounted for.\n\nLinear Logic: When Resources Matter\nGirard’s linear logic (1987) revolutionized logical systems by treating propositions as consumable resources. The difference becomes clear when we compare:\nIn classical logic:\n$$A \\Rightarrow (A \\Rightarrow B) \\Rightarrow B$$\nThis is trivially true because we can use $A$ twice. But in linear logic:\n$$A \\multimap (A \\multimap B) \\multimap B$$\nThis isn’t valid—the first use of $A$ depletes it, leaving nothing for the second use!\nThe operators of linear logic make this resource-consciousness explicit:\n\n$A \\otimes B$ (tensor): you have both $A$ and $B$\n$A \\oplus B$ (plus): you have either $A$ or $B$\n$!A$ (of course): you have as many copies of $A$ as needed\n$A \\multimap B$ (linear implication): consuming $A$ produces $B$\n\nQuantum computation differs from classical computation most notably in the no-cloning theorem: you cannot make a perfect copy of an arbitrary quantum state. This resource-sensitivity mirrors precisely the constraints of linear logic!\nQuantum Computation: Where No-Cloning Is Law\nThis resource sensitivity perfectly aligns with quantum computation’s fundamental constraints. The no-cloning theorem—the impossibility of creating identical copies of arbitrary quantum states—finds its logical expression in linear logic and its categorical formulation in monoidal categories.\nA quantum circuit demonstrates this linearity visually: each qubit follows a path through gates, transforming but never duplicating (unless explicitly measured). The Bell pair creation circuit exemplifies this resource flow:\n\nEach qubit is used exactly once—a perfect manifestation of linear logic in action.\nA simple quantum program in a linear type system might look like:\n\nThe linear function type ⊸ ensures each qubit is used exactly once.\nClosed Monoidal Categories: The Right Math\nWhile cartesian closed categories provide the categorical semantics for classical computation, closed symmetric monoidal categories give us the perfect setting for quantum computation and linear logic.\nIn a cartesian category, every object $A$ comes with natural morphisms $\\Delta_A: A \\to A \\times A$ (duplication) and $\\epsilon_A: A \\to 1$ (deletion). But quantum information can’t be duplicated or deleted arbitrarily! What we need instead is a monoidal structure, where:\n\nWe have a tensor product $\\otimes$ instead of a cartesian product $\\times$\nThere’s no general duplication or deletion\nWe still have a closed structure giving us internal hom objects $A \\multimap B$\nThe symmetry isomorphism $\\sigma_{A,B}: A \\otimes B \\cong B \\otimes A$ captures the commutativity properties essential for quantum mechanics\n\nThe category FdHilb of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces with linear maps is the prototype example - it’s symmetric monoidal closed but not cartesian closed, and gives semantics to quantum computation. The symmetry of the tensor product in FdHilb corresponds directly to the physical principle that the joint state space of two quantum systems is invariant under exchange of the systems.\nConclusion: The Tetralogical Universe of Computation\nThe journey through these computational correspondences reveals something even more profound than separate trilogies – it unveils what we might call a “computational tetralogy” where the classical and quantum worlds combine with their parametrized perspectives.\nWhen we merge the classical parametrized trilogy with the quantum trilogy, we arrive at a unified framework that encompasses:\n\nFrom classical computation to classically controlled quantum computation on linear spaces of quantum states parametrized over classical data types\nFrom dependent intuitionistic homotopy type theory to dependent linear type theory of dependent stable homotopy types\nFrom locally cartesian closed (∞,1)-categories to indexed monoidal (∞,1)-categories of parametrized spectra, which in algebraic topology corresponds to twisted generalized cohomology theory\n\nThis perspective reveals computation not as isolated islands of theory, but as a connected landscape that we can traverse through systematic transformations:\n\nWe begin with the classical computational trilogy in the bottom left – the foundation connecting intuitionistic logic, programming languages, and category theory. From here, we can follow two fundamental transformations:\n\n\nTopologize: Moving right, we enter the world of contextual computation, where the parametrized perspective takes hold. Here, types become homotopy types, logic becomes dependent, and categories give way to twisted non-abelian cohomology.\n\n\nQuantize: From contextual computation, we can then quantize to reach classically controlled quantum computation, where dependent linear type theory and twisted generalized cohomology theory provide the mathematical foundation.\n\n\nWhat continues to amaze me is how these transformations aren’t arbitrary – they follow deep mathematical patterns. The “topologize” operation corresponds to enriching our structures with spatial information, while the “quantize” operation introduces resource sensitivity and linear behavior.\nEach vertex in this tetralogy offers a unique lens for understanding computation:\n\nThe classical trilogy excels at describing functional abstraction\nThe parametrized perspective captures context-dependence\nThe quantum trilogy handles resource management\nThe combined “classically controlled quantum computation” framework brings everything together\n\nI’ve come to see these connections not just as formal correspondences, but as a roadmap for the future of computation itself. As quantum computing continues to mature and topological data analysis becomes more prevalent, this unified framework will likely serve as the theoretical foundation for the next generation of programming languages and computational systems.\nThis tetralogy isn’t a static endpoint – it’s an invitation to explore. What happens when we apply other transformations? What about probabilistic computation, or continuous computation? Each new perspective adds another dimension to our understanding, revealing computation to be not just a tool, but a profound mathematical structure that connects the deepest ideas in mathematics, physics, and logic.\nAnd perhaps that’s the most beautiful insight of all – that computation, in its essence, isn’t just about algorithms and machines. It’s about the fundamental structure of information and transformation, something that permeates not just computer science, but mathematics and reality itself.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          References\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      Please tell me if I got the references wrong.

I hope these letters can provide some comfort and guidance to those who need it.\nTo the members of the disabled and Neurodivergent community at Rice:\nTruthfully, Rice still needs to work on supporting us. I’ve often had to report campus buildings lacking braille or questionable accessibility. It doesn’t help that you must submit paperwork to verify your situation. However, while all of this is true, I’d be the first to vouch for the help you can receive at Rice. Your professors, magisters, and peers will understand if you communicate. It won’t be perfect, but people care and try their best to help you overcome your challenges. That’s what Rice’s culture of care means, and I’m sure you will do the same for others. I hope you enjoy your time here, and remember, we all move at our own pace.\nTo my new Questies:\nI can’t imagine what challenges you faced to arrive here, but let me assure you, those experiences will take you far. Unfortunately, you’ll\nhave to use them as Rice will challenge you. It might not be academics; it might be due to living far from home, dealing with friends, or\nfinding your place. College is a new experience and will present new challenges; fortunately, you will overcome them. You’ve already proven\nthat by getting this far. It will be difficult, but as a Questie, I assure you that Rice will benefit from having you more than you’ll help\nthem, so take every resource available. I know you’ll do great things here, but remember, it’s okay to ask for help—you don’t have to do it alone anymore.\nTo undocumented students at Rice:\nI can’t start without acknowledging your challenges—I’m glad you’re here. I can’t begin to understand how hard you have tried, and precisely because of this, I’ll assure you: Rice will help. We are still establishing resources to support you, but know that Rice does not represent Texas; you’ll find peers who can understand your challenges. I won’t sugarcoat it; it will be demanding, but you’ve already overcome so much and will continue to do so. Rice will allow you to grow skills and connections that will help you in the future. Taking advantage of them will be up to you, but I know you will do great things here, so stand proud.\nTo members of a minority group who haven’t been addressed:\nWelcome! Thank you for coming to Rice—your presence matters and enriches Rice. It’s hard to be the first or one of the few, but remember, there is power in your voice—use it with care. You might feel alone, but trust me, people can be understanding. You’ll find support in unexpected places and be surprised by how much you can learn from others. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed and isolated but remember; you can be the one who starts a community and forms a place you belong. You’ll do great things here, and I can’t wait to see what you’ll accomplish.\nFGLI Resources For Rice Students\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          Note\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      This section is specifically for Rice students.

Because these requests will be reviewed immediately upon receipt, only those requests requiring same day resolution will be considered. Although not an exhaustive list, requests that could be considered to be an emergency and eligible for funding include:\nRequest for rent needed immediately due to impending eviction\nFunding for co-pays or upfront costs associated with emergency surgery\n\nQuestbridge Emergency Fund:\n\nhttps://www.questbridge.org/emergency-fund/application\n“The purpose of the fund is to help support Scholars and Alumni who are struggling with unexpected emergency costs, such as an ER visit or a trip home for a family crisis. The fund does not grant money for costs that Scholars’ colleges may cover through financial aid, such as books or regular travel.”\nApplicants are eligible to receive a grant once per year.\nGrant turnaround is four weeks or less, with the idea that applicants should not have to take out additional loans in order to attend to an immediate issue\n\nWhat is considered an emergency?\n“We define an emergency as an unplanned expense that puts significant financial pressure on QuestBridge Scholars or Alumni, and threatens their health, security, or ability to continue attending school.\nA non-exhaustive list of emergency expenses includes: urgent medical expenses not covered by insurance; eyeglass replacement; hearing aids; transportation for emergency (medical or domestic), transportation to travel to an immediate family member in a dire situation; insurance deductibles; emergency childcare; replacing or replenishing basic necessities due to natural disaster, fire, flood or theft; safety related costs due to domestic violence or natural disaster.”\nOther FAQs: https://www.questbridge.org/emergency-fund/faq#Q10\n\n\n\nCollege Magister’s Fund/Residential college accessibility funds:\n\nDependent on your college, but here’s the general description:\n\nThe Residential College Accessibility Funds support the following:\nResidential College merchandise\nRice bookstore paraphernalia (excluding textbooks)\nTickets to campus-wide events such as Rondelet, Esperanza, Senior Gala\nTransportation to college related events\nOff campus dinners or events\nPeer-led trips\nOther items not listed here at the Residential College Accessibility Fund’s discretion\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          McMurtry College SEI Fund\n\n        \n      \n    \n    \n      While that’s the official description, I just got the McMurtry Magisters fund rebranded to be more understandable and accessible, and like this description better. While this was written by the McMurtry magisters for our fund, it should be the same across campus :\nWhat’s the McMurtry SEI Fund?\nIt’s a fund designed to help students overcome various financial barriers that hinder engagement in the McMurtry college experience.\nOk, that’s nice, but a little vague…what specifically can a student request funds for?\nWell, it’s hard to define specifically, but below are a few examples:(note: this is not an exhaustive list)\n\nPurchasing Murtch or expenses related to McMurtry activities, such as cleats for intramural sports.\nFunds for a dinner out with friends\nAcademic related expenses (textbooks, course supplies, etc.)\nHealth related expenses such as co-pays\nReplacing broken technology needed for school\n\nThat sounds good to me, but what if my needs aren’t on this list…\nThat’s ok - apply anyway - we know needs vary and somethings are hard to categorize, but ultimately, we’d rather be in a position to help than not know that a student is in need. We have funded requests as varied as pod storage and car parts, so please don’t hesitate to ask.\n*Wonderful - is there a cap or a range that a request should fall within?\nThe annual budget for the SEI fund is \\$1500, so to ensure the fund lasts, most requests funded are typically between \\$50 and \\$150 dollars. However, its ALWAYS better to ask.  Even if we aren’t able to fund a request, we may be able to help navigate a request through the Rice Access and Opportunity Portal or other resources on campus.\nWhat is the process..?\nFill out this form, and we will  get back to you in 24-48 hours let you know the status and, if approved, information on how to receive funds. If it’s your first time requesting, we might ask to meet with you for a couple of minutes, just to make sure we know exactly what you need and how best to fund your request. Our goal is to provide it quickly and discreetly. We have had a few issues with timeliness in the past, but are now notified immediately when a request is made. If it is something really important and urgent, feel free to come knock on our door.\nWhat if I ask for too much? What if my needs exceed $150?\nRequest anyway!!! - if the ask exceeds what we can provide, we will do our best help you connect with other resources at Rice and act on your behalf.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nCollege SEI/Magisters fund links:\n\nMcMurtry: https://mcmurtry.rice.edu/about/financialinclusivity\n\nSEI form\n\n\nDuncan: https://www.duncan-college.com/forms\n\nSEI form\n\n\nMartel: http://www.martel.rice.edu/resources/financial-accessibility/\n\nSEI form\n\n\nJones: http://jones.rice.edu/forms\n\nSEI form\n\n\nBrown: https://www.browncollege.org/financial-resources\n\nSEI form\n\n\nBaker: https://www.baker-college.com/low-income-accessibility-form\n\nSEI form\n\n\nLovett: https://lovettcollege.github.io/lovettcollege/accessibility-forms.html\n\nSEI form\n\n\nWill Rice: https://willrice.rice.edu/pages/finances.html\n\nSEI form\n\n\nSid Richardson: https://sidrich.rice.edu/resources\n\nSEI form\n\n\nHanszen: https://hanszen.rice.edu/forms\n\nSEI form\n\n\nWiess: http://teamwiess.com/forms\n\nSEI form\n\n\n\n\n\nSSI and CCD:\n\nFood pantry https://success.rice.edu/accessibility-resources/pantry\n\nAvailable by walk in Monday-Friday, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm\nVisitors will have access to non-perishable food and hygiene products.\n\n\nDress For Success https://ccd.rice.edu/students/career-resources/dfs-career-gear#:~:text=You%20may%20contact%20Dress%20for,obtain%20a%20referral%20for%20services.\n\nA referral is no longer required, but you can go through the CCD for one\nhttps://www.dfshouston.org/\nFree professional attire for job interviews, job fairs, or just jobs in general\n\n\n\nResearch/Fellowships:\n\nSER Scholars https://ouri.rice.edu/ser\n\nFor freshman and sophomores in STEM\nRegular mentoring meetings with program staff\nPaired with a Natural Sciences or Engineering lab either within Rice or the Texas Medical Center,\n$10.00 per hour for the first 150 hours of their work\nWill pay for you to go to conferences\nWill pay for you to do summer internships\n\n\nBiosciences opportunities canvas - research and fellowship opportunities are often posted: https://catalog.rice.edu/browse/biosciences-opportunities/courses/biosciences-opportunities\nFellowships resources canvas - literally a compiled canvas of available fellowships and their requirements and deadlines: https://ccl.rice.edu/fellowships-overview\n\nWork study:\n\nCCD has an explanation of how to find on campus jobs here: https://ccd.rice.edu/students/on-campus_employment\nFLI Ambassador Program: https://success.rice.edu/first-generation-and-low-income/fli-ambassadors\n\nWork study eligible students only\n\n\nMost jobs on campus will work with your work study!

Here are some resources to help you get started on your research journey.\n\nIf you are interested in research, COLD EMAIL professors. It is the best way to get started. You will get rejected, but you will definitely get a response. Rice professors are really nice and will help you out.\n\nI did this in my freshman year and got a research position in the summer in late APRIL. That was extremely late, but I still got a position.\n\n\nIt is best to note what you are interested in and what you want to do. Professors are more likely to respond if you have a clear idea of what you want to do. Even if you don’t know exactly what you want to do—it’s ok to say you are eager to learn.\nIf you are STEM, then it’s very likely you will get paid for your research or at the very least you should get summer credit hours.\nIf you want to go to a conference, then the AOP will pay for you to go. Apply for fellowships! Don’t worry about cost, just apply.\nIf you are STEM, then it’s likely you won’t have to take the GRE—this does not apply to social sciences or humanities.\nIf you want to take classes you do not have the prerequisites for, then email the professor. They will likely let you in if you show interest.\n\nIn my freshman year, I took 400 level COMP classes without any prerequisites. I just emailed the professor and they let me in.\nIf you do this, I would highly recommend not saying you are a freshman. Just say you are interested in the class and tell them your work.\n\n\nLook for REUs. They are a great way to get started in research.\n\nSpecifically, apply to this: SURF. I did not know about this my Freshman year and I missed the deadline. I highly recommend applying.\nThere is also, the NSF search. This is a great way to find REUs.\nMath REUs\nMATH Freshman apply!\n\n\nGetting a first-year internship is hard, but it’s a big plus. Often times, there\nare programs targeted directly at underclassmen from minority groups. For example, here is a list on\ntech internships. And we have some for sophomores.\nIf you are a junior or senior, then you should apply to the Rusp: Rice Undergraduate Scholars Program.\nPrograms are more receptive to touching narratives. You should unapologetically describe how your personal challenges motivate your passion.\nGet to know your peers! Sometimes they can help you find opportunities you never knew existed.\nMore links:\n\nHow to prep for Grad school if you are poor.\nAlex Leng’s NSF fellowship\nGoogle Research Mentorship\nhttps://graduate.dartmouth.edu/student-support/career-services/interview-practice-techniques/interviewing-academic-job\nTips for Writing Technical Papers\nhttps://shomir.net/advice.html\nhttps://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/\nhttps://github.com/TheShadow29/research-advice-list\nhttps://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/\nhttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf\nhttps://benhoyt.com/writings/how-to-apply/\nhttps://sites.northwestern.edu/causeway/about/\nhttp://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/public/SDM_How_to_do_Research_Keogh.pdf\nResources for Students &amp; Scholars \nhttps://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships\nhttps://ouri.rice.edu/research-and-campus-resources/for-students\n\n\nTALK TO ME ABOUT MORE TIPS LOL\nMy friend made this notion Template: https://incominvalkyrie.notion.site/w-e-e-k-l-y-copy-c48a5890bfdb42689002f6eccef2cd14\nTAing is a great way to get involved in research. You can ask your professors if they need a TA. This is a great way to get involved in research and get paid for it.\nThere are so tutoring opportunities on campus.\n\nFAQ\nTax Questions (should talk to a tax professional, but here are some student suggestions):)\n\nWhat’s a 1098-T?: a 1098-T is a tax form that the university provides to students who paid the university for tuition and fees that breaks down how to report college related expenses for taxes. If you have a full scholarship (don’t pay anything to Rice for tuition, room, or board), they don’t have to/won’t provide one to you.\nI didn’t get a 1098-T but have to file taxes. What do I do? You can email the Cashier’s office (cashier@rice.edu) and ask for a breakdown of what would’ve been on the form.\nDo I have to report my scholarship money on my taxes? (for legal reasons, these are just student suggestions and not official solutions) If you report your scholarship, anything that covers more than tuition and fees, including money for room and board, you may be taxed on. The money that exceeds tuition and fees is considered taxable income. Some students choose to not file taxes, which is an option if you make less than the cut-off requirements for annual income from any jobs you may have had. Some students choose to file taxes and just report their W2s from their jobs and not their scholarships.\nI wasn’t able to use the IRS data retrieval tool so I have to submit my tax return instead. Where do I submit that?: Emailed financial aid (fina@rice.edu) and they will add a section for you to upload it on Esther\nCheck out the Questbridge finance page! https://www.questbridge.org/resources/finances\n\nGeneral Questions\n\n\nHow do I apply for the insurance scholarship?\nSimply take a screenshot of your billing in Esther. Email fina@rice.edu, with the subject as “Allen insurance scholarship Waiver”, and ask ask to apply for the Allen scholarhip with your screenshot attached.\n\n\nDoes fin-aid cover parking?\nNo\n\n\nDoes Rice cover dental?\nNo\n\n\nAre summer classes covered?\nNo*, but if you have the pell grant you may get everything covered.\n\n\nWhat about offcampus?\nQuestbridge covers dorming, which includes both on-campus or off-campus. All QB students get three years of guaranteed dorming (this might change based on your residential college). Usually if you apply for off-campus, you are given ~7k to pay for renting fees and food. Meaning you might need to consider your rent cost and also meal plan for this budget.\n\n\nWhen should we expect our rice stipend?\nUsually, the rice stipend is given around the first week of each semester. However, for the fall semester you may need to wait until the end of august.\n\n\nHow much is the stipend?\nThe stipend is around 2.7k, however, for first semester freshies it is around 2k to over o-week\nNote that this amount may change based on your grants, parking, and insurance\n\n\nWhat about meal plans?\nIf you live on campus you need to get a meal plan, however, if you don’t then it is optional. You can see the plans here: https://dining.rice.edu/meal-plans-and-tetra)\n\n\nHow does our aetna insurance work?\nI have sent out a link in #resources explaining a summary of aetna, however, to simplify things. Insurance does not cover dental, and you have to pay a 250 deductible, after that every visit to a doctor is only 25% of the bill\n\n\nWhat if you don’t have a meal plan while you live off-campus?\nUnfortunately, some people may feel the need to skip a meal plan to budget. In this case, I would highly suggest finding good friends to swipe you for a meal. Every student gets more then enough swipes to spare extra.\nAdditionally, there are sometimes donated swipes you can apply for.\n\n\nDoes an incomplete affect our gpa / questbridge scholarship?\nNope. Usually, when a teacher offers this, you can make up the work and as long as you finish the work you will be fine!\n\n\nCan I get more aid then 8 semesters?\nYes! You need to talk to the OAA office and they will help you out, but yes!\nI got verbal confirmation from the office of financial aid that we are allowed to appeal for more aid even after 8 semester. This is granted you go to the office of academic advising and get a plan approved! This is very cool for people who had a medical leave!\n\n\nConclusion\nFor now, this is all I got, but if you know more please let me know!\n","description":"I hate when people can't succeed.
