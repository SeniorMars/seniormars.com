<p>I hate when people who want to try their best are held back by a lack of resources or accessibility. Unfortunately, I am unable to hold everyone’s hand, but I can at least provide some resources that may help you move forwards.</p>
<p>I enabled comments on this page, so if you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask. I also implore anyone who knows more resources to share them with me, so I can add them here. I hope this page helps and is considered a resource for those who require it.</p>

<p>I have written a few letters to different groups of students at Rice University. I hope these letters can provide some comfort and guidance to those who need it.</p>
<h2 id="to-the-members-of-the-disabled-and-neurodivergent-community-at-rice"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#to-the-members-of-the-disabled-and-neurodivergent-community-at-rice" aria-label="Anchor link for: to-the-members-of-the-disabled-and-neurodivergent-community-at-rice">To the members of the disabled and Neurodivergent community at Rice:</a></h2>
<p>Truthfully, Rice still needs to work on supporting us. I’ve often had to report campus buildings lacking braille or questionable accessibility. It doesn’t help that you must submit paperwork to verify your situation. However, while all of this is true, I’d be the first to vouch for the help you can receive at Rice. Your professors, magisters, and peers will understand if you communicate. It won’t be perfect, but people care and try their best to help you overcome your challenges. That’s what Rice’s culture of care means, and I’m sure you will do the same for others. I hope you enjoy your time here, and remember, we all move at our own pace.</p>
<h2 id="to-my-new-questies"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#to-my-new-questies" aria-label="Anchor link for: to-my-new-questies">To my new Questies:</a></h2>
<p>I can’t imagine what challenges you faced to arrive here, but let me assure you, those experiences will take you far. Unfortunately, you’ll
have to use them as Rice will challenge you. It might not be academics; it might be due to living far from home, dealing with friends, or
finding your place. College is a new experience and will present new challenges; fortunately, you will overcome them. You’ve already proven
that by getting this far. It will be difficult, but as a Questie, I assure you that Rice will benefit from having you more than you’ll help
them, so take every resource available. I know you’ll do great things here, but remember, it’s okay to ask for help—you don’t have to do it alone anymore.</p>

<p>I can’t start without acknowledging your challenges—I’m glad you’re here. I can’t begin to understand how hard you have tried, and precisely because of this, I’ll assure you: Rice will help. We are still establishing resources to support you, but know that Rice does not represent Texas; you’ll find peers who can understand your challenges. I won’t sugarcoat it; it will be demanding, but you’ve already overcome so much and will continue to do so. Rice will allow you to grow skills and connections that will help you in the future. Taking advantage of them will be up to you, but I know you will do great things here, so stand proud.</p>

<p>Welcome! Thank you for coming to Rice—your presence matters and enriches Rice. It’s hard to be the first or one of the few, but remember, there is power in your voice—use it with care. You might feel alone, but trust me, people can be understanding. You’ll find support in unexpected places and be surprised by how much you can learn from others. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed and isolated but remember; you can be the one who starts a community and forms a place you belong. You’ll do great things here, and I can’t wait to see what you’ll accomplish.</p>

Because these requests will be reviewed immediately upon receipt, only those requests requiring same day resolution will be considered. Although not an exhaustive list, requests that could be considered to be an emergency and eligible for funding include:</li>
<li>Request for rent needed immediately due to impending eviction</li>

      <p>While that’s the official description, I just got the McMurtry Magisters fund rebranded to be more understandable and accessible, and like this description better. While this was written by the McMurtry magisters for our fund, it should be the same across campus :
<em>What’s the McMurtry SEI Fund?</em>
It’s a fund designed to help students overcome various financial barriers that hinder engagement in the McMurtry college experience.
<em>Ok, that’s nice, but a little vague…what specifically can a student request funds for?</em>
Well, it’s hard to define specifically, but below are a few examples:(note: this is not an exhaustive list)</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchasing Murtch or expenses related to McMurtry activities, such as cleats for intramural sports.</li>
<li>Funds for a dinner out with friends</li>
<li>Academic related expenses (textbooks, course supplies, etc.)</li>
<li>Health related expenses such as co-pays</li>
<li>Replacing broken technology needed for school</li>
</ol>
<p><em>That sounds good to me, but what if my needs aren’t on this list…</em>
That’s ok - apply anyway - we know needs vary and somethings are hard to categorize, but ultimately, we’d rather be in a position to help than not know that a student is in need. We have funded requests as varied as pod storage and car parts, so please don’t hesitate to ask.
*Wonderful - is there a cap or a range that a request should fall within?</p>
<p>The annual budget for the SEI fund is \$1500, so to ensure the fund lasts, most requests funded are typically between \$50 and \$150 dollars. However, its ALWAYS better to ask.  Even if we aren’t able to fund a request, we may be able to help navigate a request through the Rice Access and Opportunity Portal or other resources on campus.
<em>What is the process..?</em>
Fill out this form, and we will  get back to you in 24-48 hours let you know the status and, if approved, information on how to receive funds. If it’s your first time requesting, we might ask to meet with you for a couple of minutes, just to make sure we know exactly what you need and how best to fund your request. Our goal is to provide it quickly and discreetly. We have had a few issues with timeliness in the past, but are now notified immediately when a request is made. If it is something really important and urgent, feel free to come knock on our door.
<em>What if I ask for too much? What if my needs exceed $150?</em></p>
<p>Request anyway!!! - if the ask exceeds what we can provide, we will do our best help you connect with other resources at Rice and act on your behalf.</p>

<p>I am pre-grad, and I’m sure many of you are too. Here are some resources to help you get started on your research journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are interested in research, <em>COLD EMAIL</em> professors. It is the best way to get started. You will get rejected, but you will definitely get a response. Rice professors are really nice and will help you out.
<ul>
<li>I did this in my freshman year and got a research position in the summer in late APRIL. That was extremely late, but I still got a position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is best to note what you are interested in and what you want to do. Professors are more likely to respond if you have a clear idea of what you want to do. Even if you don’t know exactly what you want to do—it’s ok to say you are eager to learn.</li>
<li>If you are STEM, then it’s very likely you will get paid for your research or at the very least you should get summer credit hours.</li>
<li>If you want to go to a conference, then the AOP will pay for you to go. Apply for fellowships! Don’t worry about cost, just apply.</li>
<li>If you are STEM, then it’s likely you won’t have to take the GRE—this does not apply to social sciences or humanities.</li>
<li>If you want to take classes you do not have the prerequisites for, then email the professor. They will likely let you in if you show interest.
<ul>
<li>In my freshman year, I took 400 level COMP classes without any prerequisites. I just emailed the professor and they let me in.</li>
<li>If you do this, I would highly recommend not saying you are a freshman. Just say you are interested in the class and tell them your work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for REUs. They are a great way to get started in research.
<ul>
<li>Specifically, apply to this: <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://ouri.rice.edu/research-programs/surf">SURF</a>. I did not know about this my Freshman year and I missed the deadline. I highly recommend applying.</li>
<li>There is also, the <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp">NSF search</a>. This is a great way to find REUs.</li>
<li><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://sites.google.com/view/mathreu">Math REUs</a></li>
<li><a rel="noreferrer" href="https://math.williams.edu/small/">MATH Freshman apply!</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting a first-year internship is hard, but it’s a big plus. Often times, there
are programs targeted directly at underclassmen from minority groups. For example, here is a list on
<a rel="noreferrer" href="https://careerservices.fas.harvard.edu/resources/technology-internships-for-first-years-and-sophomores/">tech internships</a>. And we have some for <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://managementconsulted.com/sophomore-summer-internships-consulting/">sophomores</a>.
If you are a junior or senior, then you should apply to the <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://ouri.rice.edu/research-programs/rusp">Rusp: Rice Undergraduate Scholars Program</a>.</li>
<li>Programs are more receptive to touching narratives. You should unapologetically describe how your personal challenges motivate your passion.</li>
<li>Get to know your peers! Sometimes they can help you find opportunities you never knew existed.</li>

<li>TAing is a great way to get involved in research. You can ask your professors if they need a TA. This is a great way to get involved in research and get paid for it.</li>
<li>There are so tutoring opportunities on campus.</li>

<ul>
<li>What’s a 1098-T?: a 1098-T is a tax form that the university provides to students who paid the university for tuition and fees that breaks down how to report college related expenses for taxes. If you have a full scholarship (don’t pay anything to Rice for tuition, room, or board), they don’t have to/won’t provide one to you.</li>
<li>I didn’t get a 1098-T but have to file taxes. What do I do? You can email the Cashier’s office (cashier@rice.edu) and ask for a breakdown of what would’ve been on the form.</li>
<li>Do I have to report my scholarship money on my taxes? (for <del>legal</del> reasons, these are just student suggestions and not official solutions) If you report your scholarship, anything that covers more than tuition and fees, including money for room and board, you may be taxed on. The money that exceeds tuition and fees is considered taxable income. Some students choose to not file taxes, which is an option if you make less than the cut-off requirements for annual income from any jobs you may have had. Some students choose to file taxes and just report their W2s from their jobs and not their scholarships.</li>
<li>I wasn’t able to use the IRS data retrieval tool so I have to submit my tax return instead. Where do I submit that?: Emailed financial aid (fina@rice.edu) and they will add a section for you to upload it on Esther</li>
<li>Check out the Questbridge finance page! <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.questbridge.org/resources/finances">https://www.questbridge.org/resources/finances</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="general-questions"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#general-questions" aria-label="Anchor link for: general-questions">General Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do I apply for the insurance scholarship?</p>
<p>Simply take a screenshot of your billing in Esther. Email fina@rice.edu, with the subject as “Allen insurance scholarship Waiver”, and ask ask to apply for the Allen scholarhip with your screenshot attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does fin-aid cover parking?</p>
<p>No</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Rice cover dental?</p>
<p>No</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are summer classes covered?</p>
<p>No*, but if you have the pell grant you may get everything covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about offcampus?</p>
<p>Questbridge covers dorming, which includes both on-campus or off-campus. All QB students get three years of guaranteed dorming (this might change based on your residential college). Usually if you apply for off-campus, you are given ~7k to pay for renting fees and food. Meaning you might need to consider your rent cost and also meal plan for this budget.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When should we expect our rice stipend?</p>
<p>Usually, the rice stipend is given around the first week of each semester. However, for the fall semester you may need to wait until the end of august.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much is the stipend?</p>
<p>The stipend is around 2.7k, however, for first semester freshies it is around 2k to over o-week</p>
<p>Note that this amount may change based on your grants, parking, and insurance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about meal plans?</p>
<p>If you live on campus you need to get a meal plan, however, if you don’t then it is optional. You can see the plans here: <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://dining.rice.edu/meal-plans-and-tetra">https://dining.rice.edu/meal-plans-and-tetra</a>)</p>

<p>I have sent out a link in #resources explaining a summary of aetna, however, to simplify things. Insurance does not cover dental, and you have to pay a 250 deductible, after that every visit to a doctor is only 25% of the bill</p>

<p>What if you don’t have a meal plan while you live off-campus?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some people may feel the need to skip a meal plan to budget. In this case, I would highly suggest finding good friends to swipe you for a meal. Every student gets more then enough swipes to spare extra.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are sometimes donated swipes you can apply for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does an incomplete affect our gpa / questbridge scholarship?</p>
<p>Nope. Usually, when a teacher offers this, you can make up the work and as long as you finish the work you will be fine!</p>

<p>Can I get more aid then 8 semesters?</p>
<p>Yes! You need to talk to the OAA office and they will help you out, but yes!</p>
<p>I got verbal confirmation from the office of financial aid that we are allowed to appeal for more aid even after 8 semester. This is granted you go to the office of academic advising and get a plan approved! This is very cool for people who had a medical leave!</p>
