I submitted this to a math poetry contest a while back and got honorable mention! I figured I'd share it here too.


> Scratch Paper
> 
> Each sheet, a battlefield of crossed-out lines, 
> 
> arrows veering nowhere, circles chasing dreams.
> 
> Three hours deep, seventeen pages sprawled—
> 
> my proof still wrong, but now wrong in new ways.
> 
> Like archeology in reverse, I stack
> 
> layers of failure, each attempt preserved
> 
> in smudged graphite and coffee rings.
> 
> The answer is here somewhere, buried
> 
> beneath epsilon neighborhoods and
> 
> desperate margin calculations.
>
> My professor makes it look effortless,
> 
> chalk lines flowing like water.
> 
> But here in my dorm at 3 AM,
> 
> drowning in crumpled attempts,
> 
> I remember reading how Erdős
> 
> filled notebooks before finding truth.
> 
> So I reach for one more blank page,
> 
> knowing that ugly paths sometimes lead
> 
> to the most beautiful places.
