Truth be told, this is not the first time I decided this nor will it be the last, so let's make this short in case future me reads this with shame. In the past, when I decided to do this, I mostly *didn't*. Sometimes I started, and sometimes I got a chapter done, but typically, it ended with me saying, "nah, this ain't it." As you can guess, I'm my worst enemy.


Writing is scary--at least to me, and every time I get an idea I brainstorm it in my head. Usually, the idea, once conceived, goes through an extra pass in my brain until I decide this is *garbage*. I know, I know. I should be more kind to myself, but when most of your life is spent reading books, you end up having *expectations* (scary, I know) about how good a piece should be. Now, there are ideas that were good enough to pass the initial pass: a book about programming languages, one about teaching, and other about code switching. Unfortunately, when I start to write I end up with two realizations: 1) someone has already written about this in a tone and format I wished I envision, 2) I need to research more, or I lack anything meaningful to add. 

Perhaps, it's not writing I like, but the *idea* of writing. I've always felt that with how much I read, I should at least give back and contribute to this idea of a resource. The problem was that I wanted to contribute something *great*. I made videos, wrote research papers, and brought proofs to life, but every time I look back, I end up wishing, "damn I could've done that better". Eventually, I realized this was idiotic, since I need experience to get better and to get experience I need to start. I could end up waiting for the right moment, and it could be that it will be great, but I think future me would appreciate having a funny little thing to look back on than a potential masterpiece (please future me :sob:).

In either case, while I did resolve myself into finishing something, it took a while longer to realize what I wanted to write.  That is until I recited my favorite poem at an open mic:

> Democracy will not come  
> Today, this year  
>   Nor ever  
> Through compromise and fear.  
> 
> I have as much right  
> As the other fellow has  
>  To stand  
> On my two feet  
> And own the land.  
> 
> I tire so of hearing people say,  
> Let things take their course.  
> Tomorrow is another day.  
> I do not need my freedom when I'm dead.  
> I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.  
> 
>   Freedom  
>   Is a strong seed  
>   Planted  
>   In a great need.  
> 
>   I live here, too.  
>   I want freedom  
>   Just as you.

Perhaps, I may be a dog-shit writer, but I do have an interesting life. The only thing is that while I have resolved myself to write something, it's kinda *embarrassing* to write about myself. At the end of the day, while these feelings are true, my desire to improve and write surpasses that--and well I am minoring in creative writing. I am going to write poetry. It may not be filled with pretty words or creative formats, but it will be true to myself. I hope you guys look forward to my work.
