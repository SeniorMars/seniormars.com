# Motivation

Time and time again, I see people struggling with their workflow. They are either too slow, too inefficient, or too unproductive. I have been there, and I have seen the light. I even taught a college class on how to maximize your workflow. However, now it is time to share my personal workflow with the world. This means I will assume you know these tools in order for us to get into the nitty-gritty of how I use them. This is the way of the SeniorMars; I'll teach you how I use my tools and how I have optimized my workflow to be as efficient as possible.

# Part Zero: Neovim

At the heart of my productivity (and unproductively) is Neovim. To convince you how powerful it is, I will be going through my configuration and workflow demos! Enough of beginner tutorials and basic setups; let's get into the real stuff. This is part one of the series, and I hope you enjoy it!

# Part One: Terminal

Okay, you have been using the terminal for a while now. You know the basics, and you are comfortable with it. But are you using it to its full potential? Do you know the tools that can make your life easier? In this post, I will show you how I use the terminal to its full potential.

# Part Two: Neomutt

Email is a necessary evil. We all have to deal with it, and we all have to manage it. But are you managing it efficiently? In this post, I will show you how I use Neomutt to manage my email efficiently. Spoiler alert: I don't use a mouse.

I intend to make this a series of posts, each focusing on a different tool or aspect of my workflow. This will be updated once a new part is published. Stay tuned!
