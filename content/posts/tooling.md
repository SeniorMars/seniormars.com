# Motivation

Time and time again, I see people struggling with their workflow. They are either too slow, too inefficient, or too unproductive. I have been there, and I have seen the light. I even taught a college class on how to maximize your workflow. However, now it is time to share my personal workflow with the world. This means I will assume you know these tools in order for us to get into the nitty-gritty of how I use them. This is the way of the SeniorMars; I'll teach you how I use my tools and how I have optimized my workflow to be as efficient as possible.

# Part One: Neovim

At the heart of my productivity (and unproductively) is Neovim. To convince you how powerful it is, I will be going through my configuration and workflow demos! Enough of beginner tutorials and basic setups; let's get into the real stuff. This is part one of the series, and I hope you enjoy it!

I intend to make this a series of posts, each focusing on a different tool or aspect of my workflow. This will be updated once a new part is published. Stay tuned!
